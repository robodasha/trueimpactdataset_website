Another objective was to study effect of particle size on biological distribution of gold NP to enable their diverse applications in nanotechnology. Gold NP of different particle sizes, mainly 15, 50, 100 and 200 nm, were synthesized by modifying citrate ion concentration. Synthesized gold nanoparticles were characterized by SEM and their size distribution was studied by particle size analyzer. Gold NP was suspended in sodium alginate solution (0.5%, w/v) and administered to mice (1 g/kg, intravenously) [n = 3]. After 24 h of administration of gold NP, blood was collected under light ether anesthesia, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and various tissues/organs were removed. The tissues were then washed with saline, homogenized and lysed with aqua regia. The determination of gold in samples was carried out quantitatively by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). SEM study revealed spherical morphology of gold NP with narrow particle size distribution. Biodistribution study revealed gold NPs of all sizes were mainly accumulated in organs like liver, lung and spleen. The accumulation of gold NP in various tissues was found to be depending on particle size. 15 nm gold NP revealed higher amount of gold and number of particles in all the tissues including blood, liver, lung, spleen, kidney, brain, heart, stomach. Interestingly, 15 and 50 nm gold NP were able to pass blood-brain barrier as evident from gold concentration in brain. Two-hundred nanometers gold NP showed very minute presence in organs including blood, brain, stomach and pancreas. The results revealed that tissue distribution of gold nanoparticles is size-dependent with the smallest 15 nm nanoparticles showing the most widespread organ distribution. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The models are used for analysis and prediction, and we conjecture that highly predictive theories will also generate original, acceptable, works. Although the quality of the works generated is hard to quantify objectively, the predictive power of models can be measured by the notion of entropy, or unpredictability. Highly predictive theories will produce low-entropy estimates of a musical language. The methods developed are applied to the Bach chorale melodies.

While community gardens have sprouted across the landscape, home food gardens - arguably an ever-present, more durable form of urban agriculture - have been overlooked, understudied, and unsupported by government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and academics. In part a response to the invisibility of home gardens, this paper is a manifesto for their study in the Global North. It seeks to develop a multi-scalar and multidisciplinary research framework that acknowledges the garden's social and ecological or material dimensions. Given the lack of existing research, we draw on the more extensive literature on home gardens in the South and community gardens in the North to develop a set of hypotheses about the social-ecological effects of urban home food gardens in the North. These gardens, we hypothesize, contribute to food security, community development, cultural reproduction, and resilience at multiple scales; conserve agrobiodiversity; and support urban biodiversity. They may also have negative ecological effects, such as stormwater nutrient loading. Because of the entanglement of the social and the ecological or material in the garden, we review three theoretical perspectives - social ecological systems theory, actor-network theory, and assemblage theory - that have been or could be applied to the multi-scalar and multidisciplinary study of the garden. We also review sampling and analytic methods for conducting home garden research. The paper concludes with a discussion of opportunities to extend the research agenda beyond descriptive analysis, the primary focus of garden research to date.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",Agriculture and Human Values,2014.0,"Taylor, John R.; Lovell, Sarah Taylor","['Ecosystem services', 'Food security', 'Global North', 'Home garden', 'Resilience', 'Urban agriculture']",http://www.mendeley.com/research/urban-home-food-gardens-global-north-research-traditions-future-directions,,,,285-305,31,2,,Kluwer Academic Publishers,,,,,,,False,127,"{'Student  > Bachelor': 7, 'Researcher': 27, 'Other': 6, 'Student  > Ph.

Using a data bank containing over 600 high quality trace element analyses of granites from known settings, it can be demonstrated using ORG-normalized geochemical patterns and element-SiO2 plots that most of these granite groups exhibit distinctive trace element characteristics. Discrimination of ORG, VAG, WPG and syn-COLG is most effective in Rb‚ÄìY‚ÄìNb and Rb‚ÄìYb‚ÄìTa space, particularly on projections of Y‚ÄìNb, Yb‚ÄìTa, Rb‚Äì(Y + Nb) and Rb‚Äì(Yb + Ta). Discrimination boundaries, though drawn empirically, can be shown by geochemical modelling to have a theoretical basis in the different petrogenetic histories of the various granite groups. Post-collision granites present the main problem of tectonic classification, since their characteristics depend on the thickness and composition of the lithosphere involved in the collision event and on the precise timing and location of magmatism.

The paper raises questions regarding the  research agendas pursued and provides some pointers for the direction of future research.  Integral to this is the argument that there is a need to reflect on the condition of small-  business research and to raise the quality of research by employing robust research methods.  This may involve questioning the role of small firms and entrepreneurship in society  rather than merely advocating them and the policy measures taken when supporting  and/or developing the small business sector. The dominance of specific viewpoints, the  methodologies used in small business studies, and the consequences of these in relation to  the development of a coherent scientific field of small business studies are also discussed.  Examples of research activity are discussed to illustrate these themes. Overall, the paper  argues that entrepreneurship and small business is a lucrative area for research. However, if  the field of inquiry is to flourish, it needs to be approached from a more critical perspective,  instead of merely accepting normative, or even strongly ideologically driven, standpoints now  dominant in so many studies. This has implications for research agendas, methodologies and  ultimately research methods training.",International Journal of Management Reviews,2009.0,"Blackburn, Robert; Kovalainen, Anne",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/researching-small-firms-entrepreneurship-past-present-future,6.0,,,127-148,11,2,,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,,,,,,,False,161,"{'Student  > Bachelor': 2, 'Researcher': 11, 'Other': 4, 'Student  > Ph.

These proteins are synthesized constitutively in detectable amounts under normal growth conditions; they can also be induced under a variety of conditions of stress including glucose starvation and treatment with drugs that inhibit cellular glycosylation, with calcium ionophores or with amino-acid analogues. Unlike the closely-related heat shock protein (HSP) family, the GRPs are not induced significantly by high temperature. Recently, GRP78 has been identified as the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP) (ref. 5 and Y.K. et al., in preparation) which binds transiently to a variety of nascent, wild-type secretory and transmembrane proteins and permanently to malfolded proteins that accumulate within the ER. We have tested the hypothesis that the presence of malfolded proteins may be the primary signal for induction of GRPs by expressing wild-type and mutant forms of influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA) in simian cells. Only malfolded HAs, whose transport from the ER is blocked, induced the synthesis of GRPs 78 and 94. Additional evidence is presented that malfolding per se, rather than abnormal glycosylation, is the proximal inducer of this family of stress proteins.",Nature,1988.0,"Kozutsumi, Yasunori; Segal, Mark; Normington, Karl; Gething, Mary-Jane; Sambrook, Joe",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/presence-malfolded-proteins-endoplasmic-reticulum-signals-induction-glucoseregulated-proteins,3.0,31.0,,462-464,332,6163,"['http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/332462a0', 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3352747']",Nature Publishing Group,,,,,,,False,124,"{'Student  > Bachelor': 19, 'Researcher': 15, 'Other': 2, 'Student  > Ph.

They are used as universal ‚Äútags‚Äù that allow specific lectins and modifying enzymes to establish order among the diversity of maturing glycoproteins.

Species in a given community may be ranked by their relative success in competition; productivity seems to be the best measure of their success or importance in the community. Curves of decreasing productivity connect the few most important species (the dominants) with a larger number of species of intermediate importance (whose number primarily determines the community's diversity or richness in species) and a smaller number of rare species. These curves are of varied forms and are believed to express different patterns of competition and niche differentiation in communities. It is probably true of plants, as of animals, that no two species in a stable community occupy the same niche. Evolution of niche differentiation makes possible the occurrence together of many plant species which are partial, rather than direct, competitors. Species tend to evolve also toward habitat differentiation, toward scattering of their centers of maximum population density in relation to environmental gradients, so that few species are competing with one another in their population centers. Evolution of both niche and habitat differentiation permits many species to exist together in communities as partial competitors, with distributions broadly and continuously overlapping, forming the landscape's many intergrading communities.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",1965.0,"Whittaker, R H",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/dominance-diversity-land-plant-communities-numerical-relations-species-express-importance-competitio,1.0,15.0,,250-60,147,3655,['http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17788203'],American Association for the Advancement of Science,,,,,,,False,116,"{'Student  > Ph.

The classical explanation, that each species occupies its own niche, seems at first unlikely because most plants require the same set of resources and acquire these in a limited number of ways. However, recent studies, although few in number and incomplete in many ways, do suggest that plants segregate along various environmental niche axes, including gradients of light, soil moisture and root depth, and that partitioning of soil nutrients occurs, possibly through the mediation of microbial symbionts, some of which are more species specific than was previously thought. Although it is unlikely that niche separation along environmental axes is the only mechanism of coexistence in any large community, the evidence now suggests that it plays a more significant role than has been previously appreciated.

Design: mothers were randomised at the first postnatal feed to receive either care by a midwife trained in the experimental protocol or by a control midwife undertaking routine care. Setting: eight wards in four English Midlands hospitals. Participants: 370 primiparous mothers with term babies who intended to breast feed, and could sit out of bed to do so. Interventions: experimental protocol of verbal-only advice on positioning and attachment, delivered at the first postnatal ward feed compared with routine care by a qualified midwife. Main outcome measures: duration of breast feeding up to 17 weeks as assessed by diaries and interviews with mothers and protocol adherence from self-completed checklist by the midwife. The mothers' self-reported experience of care and support before, during and after delivery were assessed at 6 weeks, and feeding outcomes and employment status at 17 weeks. Findings: experimental group mothers more often held the baby across their lap and received 'hands off advice', but fewer babies in the experimental than control groups attached and fed: 59% (106/180) vs. 67% (118/175), p = 0.1. No significant differences were found in the numbers of mothers breast feeding at 6 or 17 weeks in the experimental and control groups (stopped exclusive breast feeding: 76% (130/172) vs. 77% (126/163) at 6 weeks; 96% (167/174) vs. 96% (161/168) at 17 weeks; odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.22; p = 0.8; stopped any breast feeding: 35% (61/172) vs. 32% (53/167) at 6 weeks; 63% (109/173) vs. 60% (101/167) at 17 weeks; odds ratio 1.10, 0.84 to 1.45; p = 0.5). There were no significant differences in the incidence of problems with breast feeding and care experienced by mothers before or during hospitalisation (other than at the first postnatal ward feed), nor after discharge home. Conclusions: no significant beneficial effect was found on breast-feeding duration of the verbal- only advice on positioning and attachment, perhaps because aspects of the intervention are already within routine UK practice. Other care practices at subsequent feeds may negate benefits of care at earlier feeds. 'Hands off' care at the first feed may be less important to subsequent feeding than achieving a first feed under supervision in the postnatal ward. Implications for practice: midwives can be trained in a 4-hr workshop to achieve improved knowledge of 'hands off' positioning and attachment care, and these can be translated into clinical practice.

27,8324f133-de65-36aa-9812-8b36e0efad92,The Herschel -SPIRE instrument and its in-flight performance,journal,"The Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE), is the Herschel Space Observatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. It contains a three-band imaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 microns, and an imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) which covers simultaneously its whole operating range of 194-671 microns (447-1550 GHz). The SPIRE detectors are arrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 K. The photometer has a field of view of 4' x 8', observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands. Its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scanned across the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas if desired. The spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with a diameter of 2.6'. The spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25 GHz by changing the stroke length of the FTS scan mirror. Its main operating mode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the FTS mirror to acquire spectral data. For extended source measurements, multiple position offsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achieve the desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to map areas larger than the field of view. The SPIRE instrument consists of a cold focal plane unit located inside the Herschel cryostat and warm electronics units, located on the spacecraft Service Module, for instrument control and data handling. Science data are transmitted to Earth with no on-board data compression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated science products. The in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceeds predictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometer sensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, and the spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.",Astronomy and Astrophysics,2010.0,"Griffin, M.

Our 70-500 micron images taken in parallel mode with the SPIRE and PACS cameras reveal a wealth of filamentary structure, as well as numerous dense cores embedded in the filaments. Between ~ 350 and 500 prestellar cores and ~ 45-60 Class 0 protostars can be identified in the Aquila field, while ~ unbound starless cores and no protostars are observed in the Polaris field. The prestellar core mass function (CMF) derived for the Aquila region bears a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function (IMF), already confirming the close connection between the CMF and the IMF with much better statistics than earlier studies. Comparing and contrasting our Herschel results in Aquila and Polaris, we propose an observationally-driven scenario for core formation according to which complex networks of long, thin filaments form first within molecular clouds, and then the densest filaments fragment into a number of prestellar cores via gravitational instability.",Astronomy and Astrophysics,2010.0,"Andr√©, Philippe; Men'shchikov, A.; Bontemps, Sylvain; K√∂nyves, V.; Motte, F.; Schneider, N.; Didelon, Pierre; Minier, V.; Saraceno, P.; Ward-Thompson, D.; Di Francesco, James; White, G.; Molinari, S.; Testi, L.; Abergel, A.; Griffin, M.; Henning, Th.; Royer, P.; Mer√≠n, B.; Vavrek, R.; Attard, M.; Arzoumanian, Doris; Wilson, C.

31,ce113fb9-a6fc-3049-b331-3076f69d0d47,The personal and professional selves of teachers: stable and unstable identities,journal,"In much educational literature it is recognised that the broader social conditions in which teachers live and work, and the personal and professional elements of teachers' lives, experiences, beliefs and practices are integral to one another, and that there are often tensions between these which impact to a greater or lesser extent upon teachers' sense of self or identity. If identity is a key influencing factor on teachers' sense of purpose, self-efficacy, motivation, commitment, job satisfaction and effectiveness, then investigation of those factors which influence positively and negatively, the contexts in which these occur and the consequences for practice, is essential. Surprisingly, although notions of 'self' and personal identity are much used in educational research and theory, critical engagement with individual teachers' cognitive and emotional 'selves' has been relatively rare. Yet such engagement is important to all with an interest in raising and sustaining standards of teaching, particularly in centralist reform contexts which threaten to destabilise long-held beliefs and practices. This article addresses the issue of teacher identities by drawing together research which examines the nature of the relationships between social structures and individual agency; between notions of a socially constructed, and therefore contingent and ever-remade, 'self', and a 'self' with dispositions, attitudes and behavioural responses which are durable and relatively stable; and between cognitive and emotional identities. Drawing upon existing research literature and findings from a four-year Department for Education and Skills funded project with 300 teachers in 100 schools which investigated variations in teachers' work and lives and their effects on pupils (VITAE), it finds that identities are neither intrinsically stable nor intrinsically fragmented, as earlier literature suggests. Rather, teacher identities may be more, or less, stable and more or less fragmented at different times and in different ways according to a number of life, career and situational factors.",British Educational Research Journal,2006.0,"Day, Christopher; Kington, Alison; Stobart, Gordon; Sammons, Pam",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/personal-professional-selves-teachers-stable-unstable-identities,,,,601-616,32,4,['http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01411920600775316'],,,,,,,,False,273,"{'Student  > Bachelor': 2, 'Professor > Associate Professor': 10, 'Other': 11, 'Student  > Ph.

In the studies reviewed, the concept of professional identity was defined differently or not defined at all. Four essential features of teachers' professional identity could be derived from the studies. Many of the reviewed studies appeared to be studies on teachers' personal practical knowledge. However, in only a few studies was the relationship between this knowledge and professional identity made explicit. It is argued that, in future research on teachers' professional identity, more attention needs to be paid to the relationship between relevant concepts like 'self' and 'identity', the role of the context in professional identity formation, what counts as 'professional' in professional identity, and research perspectives other than the cognitive one that may also play a role in designing research on teachers' professional identity. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is not clear whether this advantage is specific to face processing or reflects a more general superiority effect in episodic memory. The current study therefore examined sex differences with a face-matching task that eliminates memory demands. Across two experiments, female but not male observers showed an own-sex advantage on match trials, in which two pictures have to be identified as the same person. This advantage was present for whole faces and when only the internal or external facial features were shown. Female observers were also more accurate in these three conditions on mismatch encounters, in which two photographs have to be identified as different people, but this reflects a more general effect that is present for male and female faces. These findings converge with claims of a female advantage in face recognition and demonstrate that this effect persists when memory demands are eliminated. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Acta Psychologica,2011.0,"Megreya, Ahmed M.; Bindemann, Markus; Havard, Catriona","['Face perception', 'Matching unfamiliar faces', 'Sex differences']",http://www.mendeley.com/research/sex-differences-unfamiliar-face-identification-evidence-matching-tasks,5.0,,,83-89,137,1,,,,,,,,,False,68,"{'Lecturer': 3, 'Student  > Ph.

Related to this, we discuss the evidence of LRRK2 activity as a GTPase and as a kinase and the available data on protein-protein interactions. Next we raise the question of how mutations affect LRRK2 function, focusing on some slightly controversial results related to the kinase activity of the protein in a variety of in vitro systems.

Self-adaptation is particularly necessary for applications that must run continuously, even under adverse conditions and changing requirements; sample domains include automotive systems, telecommunications, and environmental monitoring systems. While a few techniques have been developed to support the monitoring and analysis of requirements for adaptive systems, limited attention has been paid to the actual creation and specication of requirements of self-adaptive systems. As a result, self-adaptivity is often constructed in an ad-hoc manner. In order to support the rigorous specication of adaptive systems requirements, this paper introduces RELAX, a new requirements language for self- adaptive systems that explicitly addresses uncertainty inherent in adaptive systems. We present the formal semantics for RELAX in terms of fuzzy logic, thus enabling a rigorous treatment of requirements that include uncertainty. RELAX enables developers to identify uncertainty in the requirements, thereby facilitating the design of systems that are, by denition, more exible and amenable to adaptation in a systematic fashion.

This results in many partial models of the developing system. These models can be inconsistent with each other since they describe the system from different perspectives and reflect the views of the stakeholders involved in their construction. Inconsistent software models can have negative and positive effects in the software development life-cycle. On the negative side, inconsistencies can delay and increase the cost of system development; do not guarantee some properties of the system, such as safety and reliability; and generate difficulties on system maintenance. On the positive side, inconsistencies can facilitate identification of some aspects of the system that need further analysis, assist with the specification of alternatives for the development of the system, and support elicitation of information about it. The software engineering community has proposed many techniques and methods to support the management of inconsistencies in various software models. In this paper, we present a survey of these techniques and methods. The survey is organized according to a conceptual framework which views inconsistency management as a process composed of six activities. These activities are the detection of overlaps, detection of inconsistencies, diagnosis of inconsistencies, handling of inconsistencies, tracking of inconsistencies, and specification and application of a management policy for inconsistencies.

These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: \t \nthe PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability; \t \nthere is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs; \t \nindividual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and \t \nindividuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.",Presence: Teleoper.

Few are the settings that use immersive EVEs reporting positive results on users' attitudes and learning outcomes, indicating that there is a need for further research on the capabilities of such systems. Features of VR that contribute to learning such as first order experiences, natural semantics, size, transduction, reification, autonomy and presence are exploited according to the educational context and content. Presence seems to play an important role in learning and it is a subject needing further and intensive studies. Constructivism seems to be the theoretical model the majority of the EVEs are based on. The studies present real world, authentic tasks that enable context and content dependent knowledge construction. They also provide multiple representations of reality by representing the natural complexity of the world. Findings show that collaboration and social negotiation are not only limited to the participants of an EVE, but exist between participants and avatars, offering a new dimension to computer assisted learning. Little can yet be concluded regarding the retention of the knowledge acquired in EVEs. Longitudinal studies are necessary, and we believe that the main outcome of this study is the future research perspectives it brings to light. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We used an epidemiologic method, the case-crossover design, to study whether using a cellular telephone while driving increases the risk of a motor vehicle collision. METHODS: We studied 699 drivers who had cellular telephones and who were involved in motor vehicle collisions resulting in substantial property damage but no personal injury. Each person's cellular-telephone calls on the day of the collision and during the previous week were analyzed through the use of detailed billing records. RESULTS: A total of 26,798 cellular-telephone calls were made during the 14-month study period. The risk of a collision when using a cellular telephone was four times higher than the risk when a cellular telephone was not being used (relative risk, 4.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.0 to 6.5). The relative risk was similar for drivers who differed in personal characteristics such as age and driving experience; calls close to the time of the collision were particularly hazardous (relative risk, 4.8 for calls placed within 5 minutes of the accident, as compared with 1.3 for calls placed more than 15 minutes before the accident; P<0.001); and units that allowed the hands to be free (relative risk, 5.9) offered no safety advantage over hand-held units (relative risk, 3.9; P not significant). Thirty-nine percent of the drivers called emergency services after the collision, suggesting that having a cellular telephone may have had advantages in the aftermath of an event. CONCLUSIONS: The use of cellular telephones in motor vehicles is associated with a quadrupling of the risk of a collision during the brief time interval involving a call. Decisions about regulation of such telephones, however, need to take into account the benefits of the technology and the role of individual responsibility.",The New England journal of medicine,1997.0,"Redelmeier, D A; Tibshirani, R J",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/association-between-cellulartelephone-calls-motor-vehicle-collisions,,,,453-458,336,7,,,,,,,,,False,233,"{'Lecturer': 5, 'Student  > Ph.

A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.",The Bell System Technical Journal,1948.0,"Shannon, Claude E",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/mathematical-theory-communication-974,,,,379-423,27,July 1928,['http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf'],,,,,,,,False,10258,"{'Student  > Bachelor': 1731, 'Professor > Associate Professor': 393, 'Other': 576, 'Student  > Ph.

DESIGN Multicentre randomised controlled non-inferiority trial. SETTING 24 primary healthcare sites in New Zealand (youth clinics, general practices, and school based counselling services). PARTICIPANTS 187 adolescents aged 12-19, seeking help for depressive symptoms, with no major risk of self harm and deemed in need of treatment by their primary healthcare clinicians: 94 were allocated to SPARX and 93 to treatment as usual. INTERVENTIONS Computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (SPARX) comprising seven modules delivered over a period of between four and seven weeks, versus treatment as usual comprising primarily face to face counselling delivered by trained counsellors and clinical psychologists. OUTCOMES The primary outcome was the change in score on the children's depression rating scale-revised. Secondary outcomes included response and remission on the children's depression rating scale-revised, change scores on the Reynolds adolescent depression scale-second edition, the mood and feelings questionnaire, the Kazdin hopelessness scale for children, the Spence children's anxiety scale, the paediatric quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire, and overall satisfaction with treatment ratings. RESULTS 94 participants were allocated to SPARX (mean age 15.6 years, 62.8% female) and 93 to treatment as usual (mean age 15.6 years, 68.8% female). 170 adolescents (91%, SPARX n = 85, treatment as usual n = 85) were assessed after intervention and 168 (90%, SPARX n = 83, treatment as usual n = 85) were assessed at the three month follow-up point. Per protocol analyses (n = 143) showed that SPARX was not inferior to treatment as usual. Post-intervention, there was a mean reduction of 10.32 in SPARX and 7.59 in treatment as usual in raw scores on the children's depression rating scale-revised (between group difference 2.73, 95% confidence interval -0.31 to 5.77; P=0.079). Remission rates were significantly higher in the SPARX arm (n = 31, 43.7%) than in the treatment as usual arm (n = 19, 26.4%) (difference 17.3%, 95% confidence interval 1.6% to 31.8%; P = 0.030) and response rates did not differ significantly between the SPARX arm (66.2%, n = 47) and treatment as usual arm (58.3%, n = 42) (difference 7.9%, -7.9% to 24%; P = 0.332). All secondary measures supported non-inferiority. Intention to treat analyses confirmed these findings. Improvements were maintained at follow-up. The frequency of adverse events classified as ""possibly"" or ""probably"" related to the intervention did not differ between groups (SPARX n = 11; treatment as usual n = 11). CONCLUSIONS SPARX is a potential alternative to usual care for adolescents presenting with depressive symptoms in primary care settings and could be used to address some of the unmet demand for treatment.

EMBASE, PsychInfo and Pubmed were searched using specific terms and inclusion criteria for cCBT studies involving young people under the age of 18. A hand search was also conducted, and the authors were contacted to identify additional papers. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. These included case series and randomised controlled trials concerned with both treatment and prevention. Six different software packages were described that varied in length and the nature and extent of professional contact and supervision. All studies reported reductions in clinical symptoms and also improvements in variables such as behaviour, self-esteem and cognitions. Satisfaction with treatment was moderate to high from both children and parents, though levels of drop out and non-completion were often high.

Compressionintensive structures need not utilize materials that have tight specifications for internal force management, meaning that the production of the building materials do not require costly methods for their preparation. Where a certain degree of surface roughness can be tolerated, lower-fidelity numerical control of deposited materials can provide a low-cost means for automating building processes, which can be utilized in remote or extreme environments on Earth or in Space. For space missions where every kilogram of mass must be lifted out of Earth‚Äôs gravity well, the promise of using in-situ materials for the construction of outposts, facilities, and installations could prove to be enabling if significant reduction of payload mass can be achieved. In a 2015 workshop sponsored by the Keck nstitute for Space Studies, on the topic of Three Dimensional (3D) Additive Construction For Space Using In-situ Resources, was conducted with additive construction experts from around the globe in attendance. The workshop explored disparate efforts, methods, and technologies and established a proposed framework for the field of Additive Construction Using In-situ Resources. This paper defines the field of Automated Additive Construction Using In-situ Resources, describes the state-of-the-art for various methods, establishes a vision for future efforts, identifies gaps in current technologies, explores investment opportunities, and proposes potential technology demonstration missions for terrestrial, International Space Station (ISS), lunar, deep space zero-gravity, and Mars environments.","Proceedings of the Fifteenth Biennial ASCE Aerospace Division International Conference on Engineering, Science, Construction, and Operations in Challenging Environments (Earth & Space 2016)",2016.0,"Mueller, Robert P.; Howe, Scott; Kochmann, Dennis; Ali, Hisham; Andersen, Christian; Burgoyne, Hayden; Chambers, Wesley; Clinton, Raymond; De Kestellier, Xavier; Ebelt, Keye; Gerner, Shai; Hofmann, Douglas; Hogstrom, Kristina; Ilves, Erika; Jerves, Alex",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/automated-additive-construction-aac-earth-space-using-insitu-resources,,,,,,,['http://oro.open.ac.uk/id/eprint/45865'],"American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, Virginia, USA.",,,,,,,False,6,"{'Student  > Ph.

While early generations of mobile learning tended to propose activities that were carefully crafted by educators and technologists, learners are increasingly motivated by their personal learning needs, including those arising from greater mobility and frequent travel. At the same time, it is often argued that mobile devices are particularly suited to supporting social contacts and collaborative learning - claims that have obvious relevance for language learning. A review of publications reporting mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) was undertaken to discover how far mobile devices are being used to support social contact and collaborative learning. In particular, we were interested in speaking and listening practice and in the possibilities for both synchronous and asynchronous interaction in the context of online and distance learning.

58,2a03f5b1-c45d-3df9-8cca-6777e29f590d,'The planned city sweeps the poor away...': Urban planning and 21st century urbanisation,journal,"In recent years, attention has been drawn to the fact that now more than half of the world's population is urbanised, and the bulk of these urban dwellers are living in the global South. Many of these Southern towns and cities are dealing with crises which are compounded by rapid population growth, particularly in peri-urban areas; lack of access to shelter, infrastructure and services by predominantly poor populations; weak local governments and serious environmental issues. There is also a realisation that newer issues of climate change, resource and energy depletion, food insecurity and the current financial crisis will exacerbate present difficult conditions. As ideas that either 'the market' or 'communities' could solve these urban issues appear increasingly unrealistic, there have been suggestions for a stronger role for governments through reformed instruments of urban planning. However, agencies (such as UN-Habitat) promoting this make the point that in many parts of the world current urban planning systems are actually part of the problem: they serve to promote social and spatial exclusion, are anti-poor, and are doing little to secure environmental sustainability. Urban planning, it is argued, therefore needs fundamental review if it is to play any meaningful role in current urban issues. This paper explores the idea that urban planning has served to exclude the poor, but that it might be possible to develop new planning approaches and systems which address urban growth and the major environment and resource issues, and which are pro-poor. What is clearly evident is that over the last two to three decades, urban places in both the global North and South have changed significantly: in terms of their economy, society, spatial structure and environments. Yet it appears that planning systems, particularly in the global South, have changed very slowly and some hardly at all, with many approaches and systems reflecting planning ideas from the global North simplistically transferred to Southern contexts through complex processes of colonialism and globalisation. The persistence of older forms of planning in itself requires explanation. The paper briefly reviews newer approaches to urban planning which have emerged in both the global North and South to see the extent to which they might, at the level of principle, offer ideas for pro-poor and sustainable planning. The dangers of further inappropriate 'borrowing' of ideas across contexts are stressed. It concludes that there are some important shifts and new ideas, but no ready-made solutions for Southern urban contexts. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Bruce Seely further asked us for ""insights about where historians of technology and the Society should be directing their scholarship and activities in the years ahead."" This is a tall and problematic order: what exactly is the field we should be considering, since the study of technology is clearly not confined to self-proclaimed historians of technology? How can we even begin to give a picture of its accomplishments? Indeed, ought we not distrust narratives that purport to tell us where the historiography (and other studies) of technology has been, is, and is going? Furthermore, should we not bear in mind that exhortations that fields are shifting or ought to shift to one particular method, problem, or period often repress rather than stimulate novelty, and reflect a narrowing of conversation and debate, perhaps inevitable in diverse fields, but no less regrettable for that? In this essay I hope to avoid some of these problems by asking an even bigger prior question: what is the history of technology (in many different guises, and in many different modes) the history of? What, in practice, is meant by technology in histories, and what is meant by history in histories of technology? Our thinking about technology, and indeed our thinking about the historiography of technology, is, I suggest, uncritically focused on some, but not all, novelties. In the last generation, public policies in the United States, Europe, and the rest of the rich world have placed enormous rhetorical emphasis on the need for increased ""innovation,"" which has been reflected in increased institutional support for implicitly instrumentally useful social and historical studies of technological change. In the historiography of technology too there has been a strong focus on novelty, on radical breaks with the past. We in the academy are supposed to have got past unreflexive progress-talk, and are now (in theory, and in Theory) eclectic, playful with time, and open to the marginal. But, in historiographical pronouncements that introduce and summarize new work, a very old-fashioned and narrow progressivism is prevalent. Authors invoke the specter of a darkly ignorant past, an enlightenment in ""recent years"" (embellished with a citation to a work decades old), and a contemporary revolution. They attack paper tigers like ""whig history,"" ""technological determinism,"" and ""linear models"" as if they were made of scholarly living flesh and bone. For example, in 2003 technological determinism could still be described as a ""fast-dying horse,"" when it was surely either never alive, long dead, or, to labor the point, the slowest dying horse in the annals of veterinary science. From its creation in the 1980s till today, the ""linear model"" is attacked despite having been an object of attack from its very creation. Such caricaturing of analysts of the past has led to the caricaturing of what happened in the past, for example giving the impression that the linear model was central to belief about and policy for science and technology in recent times. In the academy, as in technology and in politics, novelty-mongering does not necessarily reflect novelty, much less progress. During the 1980s historians of technology were invited to embrace, as a supposed novelty, applied sociology of scientific knowledge‚Äîalthough this meant applying to science what was already known about technology/politics/history, as well as embodying the view (explicitly rejected by many historians of technology) that technology is applied science.

We have witnessed the emergence of new rights including ecological, sexual and indigenous rights as well as blurring of the boundaries between human and civil, political and social rights and the articulation of rights by (and to) cities, regions and across states. We have witnessed the birth of new 'acts of citizenship': both organized and spontaneous protests to include situationist and carnivalesque forms. We have also witnessed the emergence of 'activist' international courts (and judges), as well as new media and social networking as sites of struggles.

The curvature of the interface and the anisotropic property of the surface energy are taken into consideration. A 3D finite element (FE) method is applied for the calculation of transient heat and mass transfer. Numerical calculations for the solidification of Fe-1.5 wt% C alloy have been performed.

It was then proven that no set of standards (applied to the accounting alternatives per se) exists that will always rank accounting alternatives in relation to consistent individual preferences and beliefs. The major import of the result is to raise a number of questions. We know that standards do not always work. When, then, do they work? Under what types of conditions will various types of standards work; when they fail, how badly do they fail? We know that criteria systems, as in information theory, ASOBAT, or cost-allocation guides cannot be relied upon to provide the desired result in every situation. This does not, however, necessarily imply that they never provide the desired result. Hence, a major question in accounting theory must be conditions under which standards do work.

AIMS 1. To clarify the multiple meanings accorded to terms such as 'non-formal learning', 'implicit learning' and 'tacit knowledge', their theoretical assumptions and the range of phenomena to which they refer. 2. To discuss their implications for professional practice. METHOD A largely theoretical analysis of issues and phenomena arising from empirical investigations. ANALYSIS The author's typology of non-formal learning distinguishes between implicit learning, reactive on-the-spot learning and deliberative learning. The significance of the last is commonly overemphasized. The problematic nature of tacit knowledge is discussed with respect to both detecting it and representing it. Three types of tacit knowledge are discussed: tacit understanding of people and situations, routinized actions and the tacit rules that underpin intuitive decision-making. They come together when professional performance involves sequences of routinized action punctuated by rapid intuitive decisions based on tacit understanding of the situation. Four types of process are involved--reading the situation, making decisions, overt activity and metacognition--and three modes of cognition--intuitive, analytic and deliberative. The balance between these modes depends on time, experience and complexity. Where rapid action dominates, periods of deliberation are needed to maintain critical control. Finally the role of both formal and informal social knowledge is discussed; and it is argued that situated learning often leads not to local conformity but to greater individual variation as people's careers take them through a series of different contexts. This abstract necessarily simplifies a more complex analysis in the paper itself.",The British journal of educational psychology,2000.0,"Eraut, Michael",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/nonformal-learning-tacit-knowledge-professional-work,3.0,,,113-36,70 ( Pt 1),September,['http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10765570'],,,,,,,,False,652,"{'Student  > Bachelor': 32, 'Researcher': 65, 'Other': 23, 'Student  > Ph.

In the current British education system, high?stakes testing has a pervasive effect on the pedagogical relationship between teachers and pupils. The data in this paper, from ethnographic research in a working?class school and a middle?class school, indicate that the effect of the ?testing culture? is much greater in the working?class school. Using Bernsteinian theory and the concept of the ?ideal pupil?, it is shown that these pupils? learner identities are more passive and dominated by issues of discipline and behaviour rather than academic performance, in contrast to those in the middle?class school. While this study includes only two schools, it indicates a potentially significant issue for neo?liberal education policy where education is marketised and characterised by high?stakes testing, and schools are polarised in terms of social class.",British Journal of Sociology of Education,2009.0,"Hempel-Jorgensen, Amelia",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/construction-ideal-pupil-pupils-perceptions-misbehaviour-discipline-contrasting-experiences-lowsocio,,,,435-448,30,March 2015,,,,,,,,,False,32,"{'Lecturer': 2, 'Student  > Ph.

The first Lancet series on stillbirth in 2011 described stillbirth as one of the ""most shamefully neglected"" areas of public health, recommended improving interaction between families and frontline caregivers and made a plea for increased investment in relevant research.\n\nMETHODS: A systematic review of qualitative, quantitative and mixed-method studies researching parents and healthcare professionals experiences of care after stillbirth in high-income westernised countries (Europe, North America, Australia and South Africa) was conducted. The review was designed to inform research, training and improve care for parents who experience stillbirth.\n\nRESULTS: Four thousand four hundred eighty eight abstracts were identified; 52 studies were eligible for inclusion. Synthesis and quantitative aggregation (meta-summary) was used to extract findings and calculate frequency effect sizes (FES%) for each theme (shown in italics), a measure of the prevalence of that finding in the included studies. Researchers' areas of interest may influence reporting of findings in the literature and result in higher FES sizes, such as; support memory making (53¬†%) and fathers have different needs (18¬†%). Other parental findings were more unexpected; Parents want increased public awareness (20¬†%) and for stillbirth care to be prioritised (5¬†%). Parental findings highlighted lessons for staff; prepare parents for vaginal birth (23¬†%), discuss concerns (13¬†%), give options & time (20¬†%), privacy not abandonment (30¬†%), tailored post-mortem discussions (20¬†%) and post-natal information (30¬†%). Parental and staff findings were often related; behaviours and actions of staff have a memorable impact on parents (53¬†%) whilst staff described emotional, knowledge and system-based barriers to providing effective care (100¬†%). Parents reported distress being caused by midwives hiding behind 'doing' and ritualising guidelines whilst staff described distancing themselves from parents and focusing on tasks as coping strategies. Parents and staff both identified the need for improved training (parents 25¬†% & staff 57¬†%); continuity of care (parents 15¬†% & staff 36¬†%); supportive systems & structures (parents 50¬†%); and clear care pathways (parents 5¬†%).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Parents' and healthcare workers' experiences of stillbirth can inform training, improve the provision of care and highlight areas for future research.",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,2016.0,"Ellis, Alison; Chebsey, Caroline; Storey, Claire; Bradley, Stephanie; Jackson, Sue; Flenady, Vicki; Heazell, Alexander; Siassakos, Dimitrios","['Stillbirth,Bereavement,Care', 'alison', 'bereavement', 'care', 'com', 'correspondence', 'gmail', 'hills', 'stillbirth']",http://www.mendeley.com/research/systematic-review-understand-improve-care-after-stillbirth-review-parents-healthcare-professionals-e,,,,16,16,1,['http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=4727309&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract'],BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,,,,,,,False,39,"{'Lecturer': 2, 'Student  > Ph.

In fact, this goal was a primary motivation behind the development of C. elegans as an experimental organism 40 years ago. Yet it has proven surprisingly difficult to obtain a mechanistic understanding of how the C. elegans nervous system generates behavior, despite the existence of a 'wiring diagram' that contains a degree of information about neural connectivity unparalleled in any organism. This review describes three types of information - molecular data on cellular neurochemistry, temporal information about neural activity patterns, and behavioral data on the consequences of neural ablation and manipulation - that, along with genetic analysis, may ultimately lead to a complete functional map of the C. elegans nervous system. ??2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Combining literary dialogic theory with sociological approaches towards structure, it makes the claim that debate is best understood in relation to an institutional framework, in which issues of authority and dissent are variously set out and worked through. Engaging with key recent scholarship, it shows that the Homeric poems establish, and scrutinize, the assembly as an institution which accommodates dissent, in line with an understanding of epic narrative as foundational; that the historians' marginal status as writers in an oral culture manifests itself in their representing debate as a challenge to the utility of public institutions; and that tragedy marks the formal institutionalization of dissent in its adversarial structure with an onus on speaking back, offering a new way of thinking about tragic politics in terms of the process by which dissent is enacted and managed. Aimed at both scholar and student, including anyone interested in the origins of political thought, this book demonstrates not only the fundamental importance of debate to these genres, but also the ways representations of debate reproduce an agonistic mentality which intersects with and informs the broader cultural construction of a citizen community.

One such issue is in the focus placed on detailed ethnographic methods and interpretive forms of analysis, and the problem this raises for drawing out connections to changing regimes of governing and wider shifts in policy and politics. A second lies in the modernist traditions of policy studies, traditions which privilege the rational actor and deliberative subject. This paper uses my own recent research to tease out some issues of method and of theory in conducting a research project that seeks to connect individual working lives to some of the major cultural and social change in Britain over the last 60 years. The paper begins by outlining the project and some of the issues raised in interpreting ‚Äòemotion‚Äô, then goes on to show how I tried to link ethnographic data to wider questions of policy and power. The final section offers two different critical repertoires that have the capacity to link emotions and emotion work to analysis of shifting governmentalities and material conditions of work.

Although the pre-eruptive water content of the lunar volcanic glasses cannot be precisely constrained, numerical modelling of diffusive degassing of the very-low-Ti glasses provides a best estimate of 745 p.p.m. water, with a minimum of 260 p.p.m. at the 95 per cent confidence level.

The howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) clan of meteorites,generic,"The howardite, eucrite and diogenite (HED) clan of meteorites are ultramafic and mafic igneous rocks and impact-engendered fragmental debris derived from a thoroughly differentiated asteroid. Earth-based telescopic observation and data returned from vestan orbit by the Dawn spacecraft make a compelling case that the asteroid (4) Vesta is the parent asteroid of HEDs, although this is not universally accepted. Diogenites are petrologically diverse and include dunitic, harzburgitic and noritic lithologic types in addition to the traditional orthopyroxenites. Diogenites form the lower crust of Vesta. Cumulate eucrites are gabbroic rocks formed by accumulation of pigeonite and plagioclase from a mafic magma at depth within the crust, while basaltic eucrites are melt compositions that likely represent shallow-level dikes and sills, and flows. Some basaltic eucrites are richer in incompatible trace elements compared to most eucrites, and these may represent mixed melts contaminated by partial melts of the mafic crust. Differentiation occurred within a few Myr of formation of the earliest solids in the Solar System. Evidence from oxygen isotope compositions and siderophile element contents favor a model of extensive melting of Vesta forming a global magma ocean that rapidly (period of a few Myr) segregated and crystallized to yield a metallic core, olivine-rich mantle, orthopyroxene-rich lower crust and basaltic upper crust. The igneous lithologies were subjected to post-crystallization thermal processing, and most eucrites show textural and mineral-compositional evidence for metamorphism. The cause of this common metamorphism is unclear, but may have resulted from rapid burial of early basalts by later flows caused by high effusion rates on Vesta. The observed surface of Vesta is covered by fragmental debris resulting from impacts, and most HEDs are brecciated. Many eucrites and diogenites are monomict breccias indicating a lack of mixing. However, many HEDs are polymict breccias. Howardites are the most thoroughly mixed polymict breccias, yet only some of them contain evidence for residence in the true regolith. Based on the numbers of meteorites, compositions of howardites, and models of magma ocean solidification, cumulate eucrites and their residual ferroan mafic melts are minor components of the vestan crust.",Chemie der Erde - Geochemistry,2015.0,"Mittlefehldt, David W.","['Basaltic achondrites', 'Differentiated asteroids', 'Diogenites', 'Eucrites', 'Howardites', 'Vesta']",http://www.mendeley.com/research/asteroid-4-vesta-i-howarditeeucritediogenite-hed-clan-meteorites,6.0,1.0,,155-183,75,2,,Elsevier GmbH,,,,,,,False,21,"{'Student  > Ph.

The bacterium was identified as Ralstonia sp. strain MRL-TL by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy indicated the degradation of PCL by strain MRL-TL. The degradation of PCL in nature is attributed to microorganisms that secrete extracellular PCL depolymerases. PCL depolymerase was purified to homogeneity by column chromatography, as indicated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and molecular weight was found to be approximately 50kDa. The enzyme preferred substrate among p-nitrophenyl acyl esters was p-NP-caproate (C6), indicating that the enzyme is an esterase rather than a lipase. The enzyme was stable at 37¬∞C-55¬∞C (with an optimal temperature 50¬∞C) and in a pH range of 6.0-8.0 (with an optimal pH of 7.0). It was stable in the presence of various metal ions, inhibitors and surfactants. Phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) inhibited enzyme activity, which indicates that this enzyme belongs to the serine hydrolase family like other PHA depolymerases.

Hence, the names chosen as identifiers are of paramount importance for the readability of computer programs and therewith their comprehensibility. However, virtually every programming language allows programmers to use almost arbitrary sequences of characters as identifiers which far too often results in more or less meaningless or even misleading naming. Coding style guides address this problem but are usually limited to general and hard to enforce rules like ""identifiers should be self-describing"". This paper renders adequate identifier naming far more precisely. A formal model, based on bijective mappings between concepts and names, provides a solid foundation for the definition of precise rules for concise and consistent naming. The enforcement of these rules is supported by a tool that incrementally builds and maintains a complete identifier dictionary while the system is being developed. The identifier dictionary explains the language used in the software system, aids in consistent naming, and improves productivity of programmers by proposing suitable names depending on the current context.",Software Quality Journal,2006.0,"Deissenboeck, Florian; Pizka, Markus",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/concise-consistent-naming,,,,261-282,14,3,,Kluwer Academic Publishers,,,,,,,False,67,"{'Lecturer': 2, 'Student  > Ph.

Trait data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of research from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69 000 out of the world‚Äôs 300 000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40% of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation ‚Äì but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75% of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values.

Part 1 ‚Äì Measurement techniques,journal,"Residual stress is that which remains in a body that is stationary and at equilibrium with its surroundings. It can be very detrimental to the performance of a material or the life of a component. Alternatively, beneficial residual stresses can be introduced deliberately. Residual stresses are more difficult to predict than the in-service stresses on which they superimpose. For this reason, it is important to have reliable methods for the measurement of these stresses and to understand the level of information they can provide. In this paper, which is the first part of a two part overview, the effect of residual stresses on fatigue lifetimes and structural integrity are first summarised, followed by the definition and measurement of residual stresses. Different types of stress are characterised according to the characteristic length scale over which they self-equilibrate. By comparing this length to the gauge volume of each technique, the capability of a range of techniques is assessed.

Organizational learning and knowledge are important to public sector organizations, which share complex external challenges with private organizations, but have different drivers and goals for knowledge. The evidence shows that the concepts of organizational learning and knowledge are under-researched in relation to the public sector and, importantly, this raises wider questions about the extent to which context is taken into consideration in terms of learning and knowledge more generally across all sectors. A dynamic model of organizational learning within and across organizational boundaries is developed that depends on four sets of factors: features of the source organization; features of the recipient organization; the characteristics of the relationship between organizations; and the environmental context. The review concludes, first, that defining ‚Äòorganization‚Äô is an important element of understanding organizational learning and knowledge. Second, public organizations constitute an important, distinctive context for the study of organizational learning and knowledge. Third, there continues to be an over-reliance on the private sector as the principal source of theoretical understanding and empirical research and this is conceptually limiting for the understanding of organizational learning and knowledge. Fourth, differences as well as similarities between organizational sectors require conceptualization and research that acknowledge sector-specific aims, values and structures. Finally, it is concluded that frameworks for explaining processes of organizational learning at different levels need to be sufficiently dynamic and complex to accommodate public organizations.",International Journal of Management Reviews,2009.0,"Rashman, Lyndsay; Withers, Erin; Hartley, Jean",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/organizational-learning-knowledge-public-service-organizations-systematic-review-literature-10,12.0,,,463-494,11,4,,,,,,,,,False,255,"{'Student  > Bachelor': 12, 'Professor > Associate Professor': 17, 'Other': 8, 'Student  > Ph.

In particular, they are considered as a plausible origin of stellar eruptions of the V838 Mon type. V1309 Sco is the most recent eruption of this type in our Galaxy. The object was discovered in September 2008. Our aim is to investigate the nature of V1309 Sco. V1309 Sco has been photometrically observed in course of the OGLE project since August 2001. We analyse these observations in different ways. In particular, periodogram analyses were done to investigate the nature of the observed short term variability of the progenitor. We find out that the progenitor of V1309 Sco was a contact binary with an orbital period of ~1.4 day. This period was decreasing with time. Similarly the light curve of the binary was also evolving, indicating that the system evolved toward its merger. The violent phase of the merger, marked by the systematic brightenning of the object, started in March 2008, i.e. half a year before the outburst discovery. We also investigate the observations of V1309 Sco during the outburst and the decline and show that they can be fully accounted for within the merger hypothesis. For the first time in the literature we show, from direct observations, that contact binaries indeed end up by merging into a single object, as it was suggested in numerous theoretical studies of these systems. Our study also shows that stellar mergers indeed result in eruptions of the V838 Mon type.",Astronomy & Astrophysics,2010.0,"Tylenda, R.; Hajduk, M.; Kami≈Ñski, T.; Udalski, A.; Soszy≈Ñski, I.; Szyma≈Ñski, M.

Characterizing the frequency and main characteristics of multiple systems and their dependencies on primary mass and environment is therefore a powerful tool to probe this process.

In this review, we summarize our current empirical knowledge of stellar multiplicity for Main Sequence stars and brown dwarfs, as well as among populations of Pre-Main Sequence stars and embedded protostars.

Low-Frequency Range,journal,A theory is developed for the propagation of stress waves in a porous elastic solid containing a compressible viscous fluid. The emphasis of the present treatment is on materials where fluid and solid are of comparable densities as for instance in the case of water-saturated rock. The paper denoted here as Part I is restricted to the lower frequency range where the assumption of Poiseuille flow is valid. The extension to the higher frequencies will be treated in Part II. It is found that the material may be described by four nondimen- sional parameters and a characteristic frequency. There are two dilatational waves and one rotational wave. The physical interpretation of the result is clarified by treating first the case where the fluid is frictionless. The case of a material containing a viscous fluid is then developed and discussed numerically. Phase velocity dispersion curves and attenuation coefficients for the three types of waves are plotted as a function of the frequency for various combinations of the characteristic parameters.,The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,1956.0,"Biot, M.",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/theory-propagation-elastic-waves-fluidsaturated-porous-solid-i-lowfrequency-range,,,,168,28,2,,,,,,,,,False,360,"{'Lecturer': 5, 'Student  > Ph.

126,8c8ab0bf-2a4e-3e80-9fd6-76efddab0447,Outdoor sound propagation over ground of finite impedance,journal,"There is an extensive body of theory, and some laboratory measurements, of sound propagation over a surface of finite impedance. There are also reliable measurements of outdoor sound propagation in near-horizontal directions over the ground. In an attempt to relate these more closely, we have made carefully controlled measurements at ranges from 1 to 1000 ft, in most cases over grass-covered flat surfaces, to demonstrate the several phenomena that are involved. These phenomena depend on, and conversely provide a means of estimating, the values of ground impedance for waves at near-grazing angles of incidence. Such values obtained for grass-covered surfaces are in reasonable agreement with each other and with values obtained by conventional means at other angles of incidence. It is suggested that simple but accurate predictions of noise levels can be made by assuming that an excess attenuation due to finite ground impedance would always exist in a certain shadow region near the ground. This shadow region is however penetrated at low frequencies by a ground wave, to an extent that depends principally on distance and ground impedance, and at higher frequencies by interference between direct and ground-reflected waves to an extent that depends also on source and receiver heights. These phenomena, well established at ranges up to about 1000 ft and in some aspects to over 3000 ft, have been extrapolated theoretically to the order of 10 000 ft so that simple effects of topography and meteorology can be added to show how reflection or refraction acts in conjunction with ground impedance to result in penetration of the shadow region.Subject Classification: [43]28.40; [43]20.55.\nPermalink: http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.380882",The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,1976.0,"Embleton, T.

The group first met during a three day-long workshop held in Clermont Ferrand (France) between 28 and 30 May 2013. During each day, presentations were given reviewing the state of the art in terms of (a) volcano hot spot detection and parameterization, (b) operational satellite-based hot spot detection systems, (c) lava flow modelling and (d) response protocols during effusive crises. At the end of each presentation set, the four groups retreated to discuss and report on requirements for a truly integrated and operational response that satisfactorily combines remote sensors, modellers and responders during an effusive crisis. The results of collating the final reports, and follow-up discussions that have been on-going since the workshop, are given here. We can reduce our discussions to four main findings. (1) Hot spot detection tools are operational and capable of providing effusive eruption onset notice within 15 min. (2) Spectral radiance metrics can also be provided with high degrees of confidence. However, if we are to achieve a truly global system, more local receiving stations need to be installed with hot spot detection and data processing modules running on-site and in real time. (3) Models are operational, but need real-time input of reliable time-averaged discharge rate data and regular updates of digital elevation models if they are to be effective; the latter can be provided by the radar/photogrammetry community. (4) Information needs to be provided in an agreed and standard format following an ensemble approach and using models that have been validated and recognized as trustworthy by the responding authorities. All of this requires a sophisticated and centralized data collection, distribution and reporting hub that is based on a philosophy of joint ownership and mutual trust.

In order to clarify this issue we studied TiO2 nanocrystals under the partial pressure of hydrogen to modify the structural, optical and electrical properties and to significantly improve the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performance. The hydrogen treated TiO2 nanocrystals contained paramagnetic Ti3+ centers and exhibited a higher visible light absorption cross-section as was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance diffuse reflectance spectra measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The hydrogen annealed samples showed a noticeable improvement in photocatalytic activity under visible light (Œª > 380 nm) which was demonstrated by the degradation of methylene blue dye and an improved photoelectrochemical response in terms of high photocurrent density. Ab initio simulations of TiO2 were performed in order to elucidate the conditions under which localized Ti3+ centres rather than delocalized shallow donor states are created upon the reduction of TiO2. Randomly distributed oxygen vacancies lead to localized deep donor states while the occupation of the oxygen vacancies by atomic hydrogen favours the delocalized shallow donor solution. Furthermore, it was found that localization is stabilized at high defect concentrations and destabilized under external pressures. In those cases where localized Ti3+ states are present, the DFT simulations showed a considerable enhancement of the visible light absorption as well as a pronounced broadening of the localized Ti3+ energy levels with increasing defect concentration.",J.

A flat fluid interface moving steadily over a flat solid is modeled with the creeping flow approximation, which turns out to be self-consistent. Adherence is required except at the contact line itself. Though the velocity field appears to be realistic, stresses and viscous dissipation are found to increase without bound at the contact line. The way the hydrodynamic model breaks down suggests that in reality there may be steep gradients, rheological anomalies, and discontinuous processes around the contact line. Slip and the role of long-range forces are explored with the aid of the lubrication flow approximation. ¬© 1971.",Journal of Colloid And Interface Science,1971.0,"Huh, Chun; Scriven, L.

'Patriotic history' is intended to proclaim the continuity of the Zimbabwean revolutionary tradition. It is an attempt to reach out to 'youth' over the heads of their parents and teachers, all of whom are said to have forgotten or betrayed revolutionary values. It repudiates academic historiography with its attempts to complicate and question. At the same time, it confronts Western 'bogus universalism' which it depicts as a denial of the concrete history of global oppression. 'Patriotic history' is propagated at many levels -on television and in the state-controlled press; in youth militia camps; in new school history courses and textbooks; in books written by cabinet ministers; in speeches by Robert Mugabe and in philosophical eulogies and glosses of those speeches by Zimbabwe's media controller, Tafataona Mahoso. It is a coherent but complex doctrine. This article explores the intellectual and practical implications of 'patriotic history'. It contrasts it with an older 'nationalist historiography', a newer 'history of the nation', and with attempts at the University of Zimbabwe to move on to pluralist analyses and multiple questions.

Eight major continental flood basalts have been produced over the last 300 Ma. The most recent, the Ethiopian traps, erupted in about 1 Myr at 30 Ma. Rifting in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and possibly East African rift started at about the same time. A second trap-like episode occurred around 2 Ma and formation of true oceanic crust is due in the next few Myr. We find similar relationships for the 60 Ma Greenland traps and opening of the North Atlantic, 65 Ma Deccan traps and opening of the NW Indian Ocean, 132 Ma Parana traps and South Atlantic, 184 Ma Karoo traps and SW Indian Ocean, and 200 Ma Central Atlantic Margin flood basalts and opening of the Central Atlantic Ocean. The 250 Ma Siberian and 258 Ma Emeishan traps seem to correlate with major, if aborted, phases of rifting. Rifting asymmetry, apparent triple junctions and rift propagation (towards the flood basalt area) are common features that may, together with the relative timings of flood basalt, seaward dipping reflector and oceanic crust production, depend on a number of plume- and lithosphere- related factors. We propose a mixed scenario of 'active/passive' rifting to account for these observations. In all cases, an active component (a plume and resulting flood basalt) is a pre-requisite for the breakup of a major oceanic basin. But rifting must be allowed by plate-boundary forces and is influenced by pre-existing heterogeneities in lithospheric structure. The best example is the Atlantic Ocean, whose large-scale geometry with three large basins was imposed by the impact points of three mantle plumes.",Earth and Planetary Science Letters,1999.0,"Courtillot, V.; Jaupart, C.; Manighetti, I.; Tapponnier, P.; Besse, J.","['Continental crust', 'Flood basalts', 'Plate divergence', 'Rifting']",http://www.mendeley.com/research/causal-links-between-flood-basalts-continental-breakup,3.0,15.0,,177-195,166,3-4,,,,,,,,,False,169,"{'Lecturer': 1, 'Student  > Ph.

Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) of Mesozoic and Cenozoic age are the best preserved, and comprise continental flood basalts, volcanic rifted margins, oceanic plateaus, ocean basin flood basalts, submarine ridges, ocean islands and seamount chains. Paleozoic and Proterozoic LIPs are typically more deeply eroded and are recognized by their exposed plumbing system of giant dyke swarms, sill provinces and layered intrusions. The most promising Archean LIP candidates (apart from the Fortescue and Ventersdorp platformal flood basalts) are those greenstone belts containing tholeiites with minor komatiites. Some LIPs have a substantial component of felsic rocks. Many LIPs can be linked to regional-scale uplift, continental rifting and breakup, climatic shifts that may result in extinction events, and Ni-Cu-PGE (platinum group element) ore deposits. Some current frontiers in LIP research include: (1) Testing various ma ntle plume and alternative hypotheses for the origin for LIPs. (2) Characterizing individual LIPs in terms of (a) ori ginal volume and areal extent of their combined extrusive and intrusive components, (b) melt production rates, (c) plumbing system geometry, (d) nature of the mantle source region, and (e) links with ore deposits. (3) Determining the distribution of LIPs in time (from Archean to Present) and in space (after continental reconstruction). This will allow assessment of proposed links between LIPs and supercontinent breakup, juvenile crust production, climatic excursions, and mass extinctions. It will also allow an evaluation of periodicity in the LIP record, the identification of clusters of LIPs, and postulated links with the reversal frequency of the Earth's magnetic field. (4) Comparin g the characteristics, origin and distribution of LIPs on Earth with planets lacking plate tectonics, such as Venus and Mars. Interplanetary comparison may also provide a better understanding of convective processes in the mantles of the inner planets. In order to a chieve rapid progress in these frontier areas, a global campaign is proposed, which would focus on high-precision geochronology, integrated with paleomagnetism and geochemistry. Most fundamentally, such a campaign could help hasten the determination of continental configurations in the Precambrian back to 2.5 Ga or greater. Such reconstructions are vital for the proper assessment of the LIP record, as well as providing first-order information related to all geodynamic processes. ¬© 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Lithos,2005.0,"Ernst, Richard E.; Buchan, Kenneth L.; Campbell, Ian H.","['Dyke swarm', 'Flood basalt', 'Greenstone belt', 'Komatiite', 'Large igneous province', 'Oceanic plateau']",http://www.mendeley.com/research/frontiers-large-igneous-province-research,2.0,,,271-297,79,3-4 SPEC.

The paper is developed along the following lines. First, a brief historical analysis investigates the roots of this class of models that can be traced as far back as 1949 and the work of Copeland. Second, the competing points of view regarding some of its main controversial aspects are underlined and used to classify the different methodological approaches followed in using these models. Namely, we discuss (1) how the models are solved, (2) the treatment of time and its implication, and (3) the need ‚Äî or not ‚Äî of microfoundations. These results are then used in the third section of the paper to develop a bifocal perspective, which allows us to divide the literature reviewed according to both its subject and the methodology. We explore various topics such as financialization, exchange rate modeling, policy implication, the need for a common framework within the post-Keynesian literature, and the empirical use of SFC models.

A common recommendation for technical correction is maintaining a single fixed centre hub of rotation with a two-lever one-hinge moment arm to impart force on the ball. The primary and secondary spinal angles are important for conservation of angular momentum using the kinetic link principle to generate high club-head velocity. When the golfer wants to maximise the distance of their drives, relatively large ground reaction forces (GRF) need to be produced. However, during the backswing, a greater proportion of the GRF will be observed on the back foot, with transfer of the GRF on to the front foot during the downswing/acceleration phase. Rapidly stretching hip, trunk and upper limb muscles during the backswing, maximising the X-factor early in the downswing, and uncocking the wrists when the lead arm is about 30 degrees below the horizontal will take advantage of the summation of force principle. This will help generate large angular velocity of the club head, and ultimately ball displacement. Physical conditioning will help to recruit the muscles in the correct sequence and to optimum effect. To maximise the accuracy of chipping and putting shots, the golfer should produce a lower grip on the club and a slower/shorter backswing. Consistent patterns of shoulder and wrist movements and temporal patterning result in successful chip shots. Qualitative and quantitative methods are used to biomechanically assess golf techniques. Two- and three-dimensional videography, force plate analysis and electromyography techniques have been employed. The common golf biomechanics principles necessary to understand golf technique are stability, Newton's laws of motion (inertia, acceleration, action reaction), lever arms, conservation of angular momentum, projectiles, the kinetic link principle and the stretch-shorten cycle. Biomechanics has a role in maximising the distance and accuracy of all golf shots (swing and putting) by providing both qualitative and quantitative evidence of body angles, joint forces and muscle activity patterns. The quantitative biomechanical data needs to be interpreted by the biomechanist and translated into coaching points for golf professionals and coaches. An understanding of correct technique will help the sports medicine practitioner provide sound technical advice and should help reduce the risk of golfing injury.",Sports Medicine,2005.0,"Hume, Patria A.; Keogh, Justin; Reid, Duncan",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/role-biomechanics-maximising-distance-accuracy-golf-shots,,,,429-449,35,5,,,,,,,,,False,236,"{'Lecturer': 8, 'Student  > Ph.

The aims of enterprise education initiatives include helping people to start businesses; promoting awareness of enterprise; and creating the educational conditions for people to become more enterprising (Jamieson, 1984). This diversity of aims implies that enterprise is perceived differently by educationalists involved in enterprise education. This paper seeks to clarify the meaning of enterprise by exploring some key questions: 1. Why is enterprise considered important? 2. What insights are offered by enterprise education initiatives on the meaning of enterprise? 3. How useful is a study of entrepreneurs for a study of enterprise? These questions dictate a need for further research to explore and clarify the meaning of enterprise. This is crucial for educationalists who wish to educate and assess enterprise as well as decide on the educational value of enterprise education. The relationship between enterprise competencies and small business owner management and employee competencies would be also clarified with an understanding of what it means to be enterprising.

Domestic heat pumps are viewed as a potentially important carbon saving technology, given the ongoing decarbonisation of the electricity supply system. To address the lack of independent evaluation of heat pump performance, the Energy Saving Trust undertook the UK‚Äôs first large-scale heat pump field trial, which monitored 83 systems in real installations. As part of the trial, the Open University studied the consumers‚Äô experience of using a domestic heat pump. An in-depth user survey investigated the characteristics, behaviour, and satisfactions of private householders and social housing residents using ground source and air source heat pumps for space and/or water heating, and examined the influence of user-related factors on measured heat pump system efficiency. The surveys found that most users were satisfied with the reliability, heating, hot water, warmth and comfort provided by their system. Analysis of user characteristics showed that higher system efficiencies were associated with greater user understanding of their heat pump system, and more continuous heat pump operation, although larger samples are needed for robust statistical confirmation. The analysis also found that the more efficient systems in the sample were more frequently located in the private dwellings than at the social housing sites and this difference was significant. This is explained by the interaction between differences in the systems, dwellings and users at the private and social housing sites.

There is no repository that can claim to have all marine species data. Moreover, information on marine species are made available through different formats and protocols. The purpose of this paper is to provide models and methods that allow integrating such information either for publishing it, browsing it or querying it. Aiming at providing a valid and reliable knowledge ground for enabling semantic interoperability of marine species data, in this paper the authors motivate a top level ontology, called MarineTLO and discuss its use for creating MarineTLO-based warehouses. Design/methodology/approach ‚Äì In this paper the authors introduce a set of motivating scenarios that highlight the need of having a top level ontology. Afterwards the authors describe the main data sources (Fisheries Linked Open Data, ECOSCOPE, WoRMS, FishBase and DBpedia) that will be used as a basis for constructing the MarineTLO. Findings ‚Äì The paper discusses about the exploitation of MarineTLO for the construction of a warehouse. Furthermore a series of uses of the MarineTLO-based warehouse is being reported. Originality/value ‚Äì In this paper the authors described the design of a top level ontology for the marine domain able to satisfy the need for maintaining integrated sets of facts about marine species and thus assisting ongoing research on biodiversity. Apart from the ontology the authors also elaborated with the mappings that are required for building integrated warehouses.

This emphasis is now being challenged by renewed policy interest in the potential benefits of local pharmaceutical production and supply. However, there is a shortage of evidence on the role of locally produced medicines in African markets, and on potential benefits of local production for access to medicines. This article contributes to filling that gap.\n\nMETHODS: This article uses WHO/HAI data from Tanzania for 2006 and 2009 on prices and sources of a set of tracer essential medicines. It employs innovative graphical methods of analysis alongside conventional statistical testing.\n\nRESULTS: Medicines produced in Tanzania were equally likely to be found in rural and in urban areas. Imported medicines, especially those imported from countries other than Kenya (mainly from India) displayed 'urban bias': that is, they were significantly more likely to be available in urban than in rural areas. This finding holds across the range of sample medicines studied, and cannot be explained by price differences alone. While different private distribution networks for essential medicines may provide part of the explanation, this cannot explain why the urban bias in availability of imported medicines is also found in the public sector.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that enhanced local production may improve rural access to medicines. The potential benefits of local production and scope for their improvement are an important field for further research, and indicate a key policy area in which economic development and health care objectives may reinforce each other.",Globalization and Health,2014.0,"Mujinja, Phares G M; Mackintosh, Maureen; Justin-Temu, Mary; Wuyts, Marc","['Africa', 'Commerce', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Industry: economics', 'Drug Industry: organization & administration', 'Drugs', 'Essential', 'Essential: economics', 'Essential: supply & distribution', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Accessibility: statistics & numeri', 'Humans', 'Rural Population', 'Rural Population: statistics & numerical data', 'Tanzania', 'Urban Population', 'Urban Population: statistics & numerical data', 'World Health Organization']",http://www.mendeley.com/research/local-production-pharmaceuticals-africa-access-essential-medicines-urban-bias-access-imported-medici,,,,12,10,1,['http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84899517492&partnerID=tZOtx3y1'],,,,,,,,False,31,"{'Lecturer': 1, 'Student  > Ph.

Policies for universal health coverage (UHC) must address this complex private sector. However, no agreed measures exist to assess the scale and scope of the private health sector in these countries, and policy makers tasked with managing and regulating mixed health systems struggle to identify the key features of their private sectors. In this report, we propose a set of metrics, drawn from existing data that can form a starting point for policy makers to identify the structure and dynamics of private provision in their particular mixed health systems; that is, to identify the consequences of specific structures, the drivers of change, and levers available to improve efficiency and outcomes. The central message is that private sectors cannot be understood except within their context of mixed health systems since private and public sectors interact. We develop an illustrative and partial country typology, using the metrics and other country information, to illustrate how the scale and operation of the public sector can shape the private sector's structure and behaviour, and vice versa.","Lancet (London, England)",2016.0,"Mackintosh, Maureen; Channon, Amos; Karan, Anup; Selvaraj, Sakthivel; Cavagnero, Eleonora; Zhao, Hongwen",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/private-sector-understanding-private-provision-health-systems-lowincome-middleincome-countries-3,8.0,6.0,,596-605,388,10044,,,,,,,,,False,14,"{'Student  > Ph.

We summarize the insights that geographers have garnered from thinking topologically about space and power.

We show how topology, with its structuralist and modernist baggage, requires some theoretical reworking to be put to work by poststructuralist geographers.

Considerable progress has been made over the past years in the physical description of the first stages of planetesimal formation, owing to extensive laboratory work. This review examines the experimental achievements and puts them into the context of the dust processes in protoplanetary disks. It has become clear that planetesimal formation starts with the growth of fractal dust aggregates, followed by compaction processes. As the dust-aggregate sizes increase, the mean collision velocity also increases, leading to the stalling of the growth and possibly to fragmentation, once the dust aggregates have reached decimeter sizes. A multitude of hypotheses for the further growth have been proposed, such as very sticky materials, secondary collision processes, enhanced growth at the snow line, or cumulative dust effects with gravitational instability.

She defines the concept of professionalism, reviews the psychometric properties of key approaches to assessing professionalism, conveys major findings that these approaches produced, and discusses recommendations to improve the assessment of professionalism. METHOD The author reviewed professionalism literature from the last 30 years that had been identified through database searches; included in conference proceedings, bibliographies, and reference lists; and suggested by experts. The cited literature largely came from peer-reviewed journals, represented themes or novel approaches, reported qualitative or quantitative data about measurement instruments, or described pragmatic or theoretical approaches to assessing professionalism. RESULTS A circumscribed concept of professionalism is available to serve as a foundation for next steps in assessing professional behavior. The current array of assessment tools is rich. However, their measurement properties should be strengthened. Accordingly, future research should explore rigorous qualitative techniques; refine quantitative assessments of competence, for example, through OSCEs; and evaluate separate elements of professionalism. It should test the hypothesis that assessment tools will be better if they define professionalism as behaviors expressive of value conflicts, investigate the resolution of these conflicts, and recognize the contextual nature of professional behaviors. Whether measurement tools should be tailored to the stage of a medical career and how the environment can support or sabotage the assessment of professional behavior are central issues.

High degrees of correlation between gas and electricity prices - as observed in most European markets - reduce gas plant risks and make portfolios dominated by gas plant more attractive.

We suggest that the first stage of this process will include replacing or extending the life of existing nuclear power plants, with continued incremental improvements in efficiency and reliability. After 2030, a large-scale second period of construction would allow nuclear energy to contribute substantially to the decarbonization of electricity generation. For nuclear energy to be sustainable, new large-scale fuel cycles will be required that may include fuel reprocessing. Here, we explore the opportunities and constraints in both time periods and suggests ways in which measures taken today might, at modest cost, provide more options in the decades to come. Careful long-term planning, along with parallel efforts aimed at containing waste products and avoiding diversion of material into weapons production, can ensure that nuclear power generation remains a carbon-neutral option.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2010.0,"Grimes, Robin W; Nuttall, William J","['10', '1126', '1188928', '2010', '799', 'a two-stage nuclear renaissance', 'doi', 'erating the option of', 'grimes and william j', 'nuttall', 'robin w', 'science', 'science 329']",http://www.mendeley.com/research/generating-option-twostage-nuclear-renaissance,8.0,13.0,,799-803,329,5993,['http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20705854'],,,,,,,,False,81,"{'Student  > Bachelor': 6, 'Researcher': 25, 'Other': 3, 'Student  > Ph.

Alexander et al. (p. 721, published online 12 July) estimated the hydrogen isotopic compositions in 86 samples of primitive meteorites that fell in Antarctica and compared the results to those of comets and Saturn's moon, Enceladus. Water in primitive meteorites was less deuteriumrich than that in comets and Enceladus, implying that, in contradiction to recent models of the dynamical evolution of the solar system, the parent bodies of primitive meteorites cannot have formed in the same region as comets. The results also suggest that comets were not the principal source of Earth's water.\nDetermining the source(s) of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen accreted by Earth is important for understanding the origins of water and life and for constraining dynamical processes that operated during planet formation. Chondritic meteorites are asteroidal fragments that retain records of the first few million years of solar system history.

The data reviewed are consistent with an external, stellar origin for most short-lived radionuclides (7Be, 10Be, and 36Cl are important exceptions) and a shock-wave model for chondrule formation, and provide a sound basis for early Solar System chronology. They are inconsistent with the x-wind model for the origin of chondritic components and a local, irradiation origin of 26Al, 41Ca, and 53Mn. 10Be is heterogeneously distributed among CAIs, indicating its formation by local irradiation and precluding its use for the early solar system chronology. 41Ca-41K, and 60Fe-60Ni systematics are important for understanding the astrophysical setting of Solar System formation and origin of short-lived radionuclides, but so far have limited implications for the chronology of chondritic components. The chronological significance of oxygen-isotope compositions of chondritic components is limited. The following general picture of formation of chondritic components is inferred. CAIs and AOAs were the first solids formed in the solar nebula ???4567-4568 Myr ago, possibly within a period of <0.1 Myr, when the Sun was an infalling (class 0) and evolved (class I) protostar. They formed during multiple transient heating events in nebular region(s) with high ambient temperature (at or above condensation temperature of forsterite), either throughout the inner protoplanetary disk (1-4 AU) or in a localized region near the proto-Sun (<0.1 AU), and were subsequently dispersed throughout the disk. Most CAIs and AOAs formed in the presence of an 16O-rich (??17O ??? -24 ?? 2???) nebular gas. The 26Al-poor [(26Al/27Al)0 < 1 ?? 10-5], 16O-rich (??17O ??? -24 ?? 2???) CAIs - FUN (fractionation and unidentified nuclear effects) CAIs in CV chondrites, platy hibonite crystals (PLACs) in CM chondrites, pyroxene-hibonite spherules in CM and CO chondrites, and the majority of grossite- and hibonite-rich CAIs in CH chondrites-may have formed prior to injection and/or homogenization of 26Al in the early Solar System. A small number of igneous CAIs in ordinary, enstatite and carbonaceous chondrites, and virtually all CAIs in CB chondrites are 16O-depleted (??17O > -10???) and have (26Al/27Al)0 similar to those in chondrules (<1 ?? 10-5). These CAIs probably experienced melting during chondrule formation. Chondrules and most of the fine-grained matrix materials in primitive chondrites formed 1-4 Myr after CAIs, when the Sun was a classical (class II) and weak-lined T Tauri star (class III). These chondritic components formed during multiple transient heating events in regions with low ambient temperature (<1000 K) throughout the inner protoplanetary disk in the presence of 16O-poor (??17O > -5???) nebular gas. The majority of chondrules within a chondrite group may have formed over a much shorter period of time (<0.5-1 Myr). Mineralogical and isotopic observations indicate that CAIs were present in the regions where chondrules formed and accreted (1-4 AU), indicating that CAIs were present in the disk as free-floating objects for at least 4 Myr. Many CAIs, however, were largely unaffected by chondrule melting, suggesting that chondrule-forming events experienced by a nebular region could have been small in scale and limited in number. Chondrules and metal grains in CB chondrites formed during a single-stage, highly-energetic event ???4563 Myr ago, possibly from a gas-melt plume produced by collision between planetary embryos. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The most extreme hyperthermal was the ‚àº170 thousand year (kyr) interval of 5-7 ¬∞C global warming during the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, 56‚ÄâMyr ago). The PETM is widely attributed to massive release of greenhouse gases from buried sedimentary carbon reservoirs, and other, comparatively modest, hyperthermals have also been linked to the release of sedimentary carbon. Here we show, using new 2.4-Myr-long Eocene deep ocean records, that the comparatively modest hyperthermals are much more numerous than previously documented, paced by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and have shorter durations (‚àº40‚Äâkyr) and more rapid recovery phases than the PETM. These findings point to the operation of fundamentally different forcing and feedback mechanisms than for the PETM, involving redistribution of carbon among Earth's readily exchangeable surface reservoirs rather than carbon exhumation from, and subsequent burial back into, the sedimentary reservoir. Specifically, we interpret our records to indicate repeated, large-scale releases of dissolved organic carbon (at least 1,600 gigatonnes) from the ocean by ventilation (strengthened oxidation) of the ocean interior. The rapid recovery of the carbon cycle following each Eocene hyperthermal strongly suggests that carbon was re-sequestered by the ocean, rather than the much slower process of silicate rock weathering proposed for the PETM. Our findings suggest that these pronounced climate warming events were driven not by repeated releases of carbon from buried sedimentary sources, but, rather, by patterns of surficial carbon redistribution familiar from younger intervals of Earth history.",Nature,2011.0,"Sexton, Philip F; Norris, Richard D; Wilson, Paul a; P√§like, Heiko; Westerhold, Thomas; R√∂hl, Ursula; Bolton, Clara T; Gibbs, Samantha",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/eocene-global-warming-events-driven-ventilation-oceanic-dissolved-organic-carbon,,,,349-352,471,7338,,,,,,,,,False,196,"{'Lecturer': 2, 'Student  > Ph.

As one application for this concept, we introduce a new type of microscope capable of investi-gating surfaces of insulators on an atomic scale. The atomic force microscope is a combination of the principles of the scanning tunneling microscope and the stylus profilometer. It incorporates a probe that does not damage the surface. Our preliminary results in air demonstrate a lateral resolu-0 0 tion of 30 A and a vertical resolution less than 1 A. PACS numbers: 68.35.Gy %e are concerned in this paper with the measure-ment of ultrasmall forces on particles as small as single atoms. %e propose to do this by monitoring the elas-tic deformation of various types of springs with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). ' It has been a common practice to use the displacement of springs as a measure of force, and previous methods have relied on electrostatic fields, magnetostatic fields, optical waves, and x rays. Jones~ has reviewed the devices that use variable capacitances and he reports that dis-placements of 10 4 A can be measured. SQUIDs3 are superconducting elements that measure the expulsion of magnetic fields in variable-inductance devices. They are used in gravity gradiometers to measure dis-placements of 10 6 A. Tabor and co-workers in their work with van der Waals forces have used optical in-terference methods to measure displacements of 1 A. With an x-ray interferometer constructed from a single crystal of silicon, Deslattes' has also measured dis-placements of 10 A which is about 1'/0 of the nuclear diameter. We are proposing a new system wherein the STM is used to measure the motion of a cantilever beam with an ultrasmall mass. The force required to move this beam through measurable distances (10 A) can be as small as 10 ' N. The masses involved in the other techniques are too large to reach this value. This level of sensitivity clearly penetrates the regime of inter-atomic forces between single atoms and opens the door to a variety of applications. The atomic force micro-scope (AFM) is a new tool designed to exploit this lev-el of sensitivity. It will be used to investigate both conductors and insulators on an atomic scale. %e en-vision a general-purpose device that will measure any type of force; not only the interatomic forces, but elec-tromagnetic forces as well. %ith the STM, 6 the atomic surface structure of con-ductors is well resolved. For bulk insulators7 an equivalent method is missing although the stylus profi-lometer (SP)8 9 has been developed into a powerful microscopic technique. Teague et al. ' have used the SP to record three-dimensional images of surfaces with a lateral resolution of 1000 A and a vertical resolution of 10 A. A related technique is the scanning capaci-tance microscope described by Matey and Blanc. "" They report a lateral resolution of 5000 A and a verti-cal resolution of 2 A. The SP has much in common with the STM. The tip in the STM and the stylus in the SP are both used to scan the surface, sense the variations of the sample, and generate three-dimensional images. The stylus in the profilometer is carried by a cantilever beam and it rides on the sample surface. This means that a rough surface can be plastically deformed. "" The radius of this stylus is about 1 p, m, and the loading force ex-tends from 10 to 10 N. ' The spring in the AFM is a critical component. %e need the maximum deflection for a given force. This requires a spring that is as soft as possible. At the same time a stiff spring with high resonant frequency is necessary in order to minimize the sensitivity to vi-brational noise from the building near 100 Hz. The resonant frequency, fo, of the spring system is given by f0= (I/2sr)(k/nto)', where k is the spring con-stant and ttto is the effective mass that loads the spring. This relation suggests a simple way out of our dilem-ma. As we decrease k to soften the spring we must also decrease mo to keep the ratio k/mo large. The limiting case, illustrated in Fig. 1, is but a single atom adsorbed at site A in the gap of an STM. It has its own mass and an effective k that comes from the coupling to neighboring atoms. The mass of the spring in manmade structures can be quite small but eventually microfabrication'4 will be employed to fabricate a spring with a mass less than 10 '0 kg and a resonant frequency greater than 2 kHz. Displacements of 10 A can be measured with the STM when the tunneling gap is modulated.

It can also be used to measure force-versus-distance curves. Such curves, briefly called force curves, provide valuable information on local material properties such as elasticity, hardness, Hamaker constant, adhesion and surface charge densities. For this reason the measurement of force curves has become essential in different fields of research such as surface science, materials engineering, and biology. Another application is the analysis of surface forces per se. Some of the most fundamental questions in colloid and surface science can be addressed directly with the AFM: What are the interactions between particles in a liquid? How can a dispersion be stabilized? How do surfaces in general and particles in particular adhere to each other? Particles and surfaces interactions have major implications for friction and lubrication. Force measurements on single molecules involving the rupture of single chemical bonds and the stretching of polymer chains have almost become routine. The structure and properties of confined liquids can be addressed since force measurements provide information on the energy of a confined liquid film. After the review of Cappella [B. Cappella, G. Dietler, Surf. Sci. Rep. 34 (1999) 1-104] 6 years of intense development have occurred. In 1999, the AFM was used only by experts to do force measurements. Now, force curves are used by many AFM researchers to characterize materials and single molecules. The technique and our understanding of surface forces has reached a new level of maturity. In this review we describe the technique of AFM force measurements. Important experimental issues such as the determination of the spring constant and of the tip radius are discussed. Current state of the art in analyzing force curves obtained under different conditions is presented. Possibilities, perspectives but also open questions and limitations are discussed. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that this could be achieved by recognizing the importance of metacognition and creating an instructional approach that develops students' metacognitive knowledge and skills through a process of scaffolded inquiry, reflection, and generalization. Toward this end, we collaborated with teachers to create a computer enhanced, middle school science curriculum that engages students in learning about and reflecting on the processes of scientific inquiry as they construct increasingly complex models of force and motion phenomena. The resulting ThinkerTools Inquiry Curriculum centers around a metacognitive model of research, called the Inquiry Cycle, and a metacognitive process, called Reflective Assessment, in which students reflect on their own and each other's inquiry. In this article, we report on instructional trials of the curriculum by teachers in urban classrooms, including a controlled comparison to determine the impact of including or not including the Reflective Assessment Process. Overall, the curriculum proved successful and students' performance improved significantly on both physics and inquiry assessments. The controlled comparison revealed that students' learning was greatly facilitated by Reflective Assessment. Furthermore, adding this metacognitive process to the curriculum was particularly beneficial for low-achieving students: Performance on their research projects and inquiry tests was significantly closer to that of high-achieving students than was the case in the control classes. Thus, this approach has the valuable effect of reducing the educational disadvantage of low-achieving students while also being beneficial for high-achieving students. We argue that these findings have strong implications for what such metacognitively focused, inquiry-oriented curricula can accomplish, particularly in urban school settings in which there are many disadvantaged students.",Cognition and Instruction,1998.0,"White, Barbara Y; Frederiksen, John R",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/inquiry-modeling-metacognition-making-science-accessible-students,,,,3-118,16,1,['http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&doi=10.1207/s1532690xci1601_2&magic=crossref'],,,,,,,,False,455,"{'Student  > Bachelor': 12, 'Professor > Associate Professor': 45, 'Other': 12, 'Student  > Ph.

The second focuses on the processes that dictate the behavior of the orogenic system today. It is argued that these processes have not changed substantially over the Miocene‚ÄìHolo- cene interval, which suggests that the orogen has achieved a quasi‚Äìsteady state. This condition implies a rough balance between plate-tectonic processes that lead to the accumulation of energy in the orogen and many other processes (e.g., erosion of the Himalayan front and the lateral flow of the middle and lower crust of Tibet) that lead to the dissipation of energy. The tectonics of the Himalaya and Tibet are thus intimately related; the Himalaya might have evolved very differ- ently had the Tibetan Plateau never have formed.",Bulletin of the Geological Society of America,2000.0,"Hodges, K.

Dynamic properties (pulse number, PN; call rate, CR; and duty cycle, DC, the ratio of call duration to call period) varied much more within bouts of calling than a static property (dominant frequency, DF) but nevertheless exhibited significant between male variation in three of four breeding seasons. Many multiply recorded males consistently produced calls with values substantially above or below mean values of males recorded on the same nights. Nightly ranges of variation in PN and CR were often greater than the minimum differences required to elicit female preferences in the laboratory. In most experiments, females chose high-PN or fast-CR calls over low-PN or slow-CR alternatives, respectively, even if the preferred stimuli were farther away or 6-10 dB lower in sound pressure level (SPL), provided that differences in PN or CR were 100%. Consistent with these results, females did not always choose the closer of two calling males in the field. Nightly ranges of variation in DF rarely equaled the minimum difference required to elicit SPL-independent preferences. Females preferred a stimulus of high-PN and slow-CR over an alternative of low-PN or fast-CR with the same acoustic on- time; in two experiments, females chose calls of high-PN over low-PN alternatives even though the playback of the high-PN call was interrupted and the low-PN call was broadcast continuously. Thus, female preferences were not merely based on the total time of acoustic stimulation.

There were no consistent patterns of gender or social class variation in their use, but a clear social class difference in the use of certain forms, with ""and that"" favoured by the working-class speakers and ""and stuff"" and ""and things"" preferred by the middle-class adolescents. The most frequent forms were analysed in terms of phonetic reduction, decategorisation, semantic change and pragmatic shift, changes that together make up the process of grammaticalisation. ""And that"" and ""and everything"" were the most grammaticalised, followed by ""or something,"" with ""and stuff"" and ""and things"" lagging behind. The multifunctionality of the general extenders caused problems for a rigorous analysis of their pragmatic functions. The paper argues that we must consider their functions within the local contexts in which they occur, to take account of their interaction with other linguistic forms. It is also important to avoid generalising about their functions and, instead, to prioritise the fact that as pragmatic particles they are multifunctional. In this data the general extenders had functions in every communicative domain, often simultaneously. The implications for the quantitative analysis of discourse forms are also considered.

Suggestions are offered to achieve comparability, and a case is made for a consistent integration of pragmatic function as a factor group in the analysis. The extension of the variationist paradigm to the level of discourse is discussed, and the need for a definition of discourse variables which caters for their flexibility and multifunctionality is demonstrated.

In fact, height differences were low during the influenza/famine period of 1918-1920, and the Great Depression period. With the growing openness of the late 1920s, we observe a temporary rise in height inequality. The overall level of height inequality is lower than expected for Indian society that is influenced by a rigid caste system. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Infertility is considered a curse for women, especially in India where the female partner is blamed in almost all cases. This study is based on the Chenchu tribe of the Nallamalai forest area, India. The main objective of this study is to highlight important aspects of infertility, such as perceptions, causes, and treatment-seeking behaviour. The other objective is to show the relation between infertility and inheritance, remarriage, divorce pattern, beliefs and practices. Qualitative techniques such as participant observation, in-depth interviews and unstructured key informant interviews were administered towards the fulfilment of the objectives. Chenchus relate infertility to spirits and dietary habits, and their treatment-seeking behaviour is based on their traditional knowledge of herbs and spiritual beliefs. Umbilical cord consumption is also considered as a remedy for infertility. The actual cause of infertility is related to sexually transmitted diseases, abortions, and adolescent sterility. There is a pressing need for imparting both preventive and curative biomedical care.

The new method is based on quantifying changes in phase and amplitude of temperature variations between pairs of subsurface sensors. For a reasonable range of streambed thermal properties and sensor spacings the time series method should allow reliable estimation of seepage rates for a range of at least +/- 10 m d(-1) (+/- 1.2 x 10(-2) m s(-1)), with amplitude variations being most sensitive at low flow rates and phase variations retaining sensitivity out to much higher rates. Compared to forward modeling, the new method requires less observational data and less setup and data handling and is faster, particularly when interpreting many long data sets. The time series method is insensitive to streambed scour and sedimentation, which allows for application under a wide range of flow conditions and allows time series estimation of variable streambed hydraulic conductivity.

A rapidly increasing number of papers demonstrate that heat as a tracer is becoming an integral part of the toolbox used to investigate water flow in the environment. We summarise the existing body of research investigating natural and induced heat transport, and analyse the progression in fundamental and natural process understanding through the qualitative and quantitative use of heat as a tracer. Heat transport research in engineering applications partly overlaps with heat tracing research in the earth sciences but is more advanced in the fundamental understanding. Combining the findings from both areas can enhance our knowledge of the heat transport processes and highlight where research is needed. Heat tracing relies upon the mathematical heat transport equation which is subject to certain assumptions that are often neglected. This review reveals that, despite the research efforts to date, the capability of the Fourier-model applied to conductive-convective heat transport in water saturated natural materials has not yet been thoroughly tested. However, this is a prerequisite for accurate and meaningful heat transport modelling with the purpose of increasing our understanding of flow processes at different scales. This review reveals several knowledge gaps that impose significant limitations on practical applications of heat as a tracer of water flow. The review can be used as a guide for further research directions on the fundamental as well as the practical aspects of heat transport on various scales from the lab to the field. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Earth-Science Reviews,2014.0,"Rau, Gabriel C.; Andersen, Martin S.; McCallum, Andrew M.; Roshan, Hamid; Acworth, R.

This knowledge has accumulated through a long series of observations transmitted from generation to generation. Such ''diachronic'' observations can be of great value and complement the ''synchronic''observations on which western science is based. Where indigenous peoples have depended, for long periods of time, on local environments for the provision of a variety of resources, they have developed a stake in conserving, and in some cases, enhancing, biodiversity. They are aware that biological diversity is a crucial factor in generating the ecological services and natural resources on which they depend. Some indigenous groups manipulate the local landscape to augment its heterogeneity, and some have been found to be motivated to restore biodiversity in degraded landscapes. Their practices for the conservation of biodiversity were grounded in a series of rules of thumb which are apparently arrived at through a trial and error process over a long historical time period. This implies that their knowledge base is indefinite and their implementation involves an intimate relationship with the belief system. Such knowledge is difficult for western science to understand. It is vital, however, that the value of the knowledge-practice-belief complex of indigenous peoples relating to conservation of biodiversity is fully recognized if ecosystems and biodiversity are to be managed sustainably.

Analyses of subjects' RTs for strings of varying lengths demonstrated that: (a) subjects were able to distinguish relevant from redundant task information, and to limit their processing to the relevant information, (b) the ability to reduce the amount of information that is processed takes time and develops gradually over the course of practice, and (c) the mechanism underlying this ability appears to be largely stimulus-independent in the sense that structural components of a task are ignored, rather than specific task information.

However, our notions of good science might constrain these contributions. We argue that for grounded theorists a tension might exist between a desire to create a contextualised theory of leadership and a desire for scientifically justified issues of validity and generalizable theory. We also explore how the outcome of grounded theory research can create a dissonance between theories that resonate with the reality they are designed to explore, and the theories that resonate with a particular yet dominant 'scientific' approach in the field of leadership studies - the philosophy of science commonly known as positivism. We examine the opportunities provided by an alternative philosophy of science, that of critical realism. We explore how conducting grounded theory research informed by critical realism might strengthen researchers' confidence to place emphasis on an understanding and explanation of contextualised leadership as a scientific goal, rather than the scientific goal of generalization through empirical replication. Two published accounts of grounded theory are critiqued candidly to help emphasise our arguments.

This paper reviews the literature of the multi-criteria decision making approaches for supplier evaluation and selection. Related articles appearing in the international journals from 2000 to 2008 are gathered and analyzed so that the following three questions can be answered: (i) Which approaches were prevalently applied? (ii) Which evaluating criteria were paid more attention to? (iii) Is there any inadequacy of the approaches? Based on the inadequacy, if any, some improvements and possible future work are recommended.

While the external loadings acting on a material or component are clearly important, There are other contributory factors including unfavourable materials microstructure, pre- existing defects and residual stresses. Residual stresses can add to, or subtract from, the applied stresses and so when unexpected failure occurs it is often because residual stresses have combined critically with the applied stresses, or because together with the presence of undetected defects they have dangerously lowered the applied stress at which failure will occur. Consequently it is important that the origins of residual stress are understood, opportunities for removing harmful or introducing beneficial residual stresses recognized, their evolution in-service predicted, their influence on failure processes understood and safe structural integrity assessments made, so as to either remove the part prior to failure, or to take corrective action to extend life. This paper reviews the progress in these aspects in the light of the basic failure mechanisms.

Methodological weaknesses of earlier studies were addressed by: recruiting participants who had retired on ill health grounds; excluding participants with a history of acute poisoning, medical or psychiatric conditions that might account for ill health; and exploring factors which may render some individuals more vulnerable to the effects of OPs than others. Performance on tests of cognition and mood of 127 exposed sheep farmers (67 working, 60 retired) was compared with 78 unexposed controls (38 working, 40 retired) and published test norms derived from a cross section of several thousand adults in the general population. Over 40% of the exposed cohort reported clinically significant levels of anxiety and depression compared to less than 23% of controls. Exposed subjects performed significantly worse than controls and standardisation samples on tests of memory, response speed, fine motor control, mental flexibility and strategy making, even after controlling for the effects of mood. The pattern was similar for both working and retired groups. The cognitive deficits identified cannot be attributed to mood disorder, malingering, a history of acute exposure or genetic vulnerability in terms of PON1192 polymorphisms.

Concern about the effects of OPs on human health has been growing as they are increasingly used throughout the world for a variety of agricultural, industrial and domestic purposes. The neurotoxic effects of acute poisoning are well established but the possibility that low-level exposure causes ill health is controversial. It is important to get a clear answer to this question as more individuals are at risk of low-level exposure than acute poisoning. Although a number of reviews on this topic have been published in the past, authors have come to conflicting conclusions. To date, none of these reviews have attempted quantitative evaluation of study findings using meta-analysis. This paper reviews the available evidence concerning the neurotoxicity of low-level occupational exposure to OPs and goes on to report the results of a meta-analysis of 14 studies which fulfilled criteria for this type of statistical analysis (means and standard deviations of dependant variables reported). Data were assimilated from more than 1600 participants. The majority of well designed studies found a significant association between low-level exposure to OPs and impaired neurobehavioral function which is consistent, small to moderate in magnitude and concerned primarily with cognitive functions such as psychomotor speed, executive function, visuospatial ability, working and visual memory.

An important characteristic of Twitter is its real-time nature. For example, when an earthquake occurs, people make many Twitter posts (tweets) related to the earthquake, which enables detection of earthquake occurrence promptly, simply by observing the tweets. As described in this paper, we investigate the real-time interaction of events such as earthquakes in Twitter and propose an algorithm to monitor tweets and to detect a target event. To detect a target event, we devise a classifier of tweets based on features such as the keywords in a tweet, the number of words, and their context. Subsequently, we produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target event that can find the center and the trajectory of the event location. We consider each Twitter user as a sensor and apply Kalman filtering and particle filtering, which are widely used for location estimation in ubiquitous/pervasive computing. The particle filter works better than other comparable methods for estimating the centers of earthquakes and the trajectories of typhoons. As an application, we construct an earthquake reporting system in Japan. Because of the numerous earthquakes and the large number of Twitter users throughout the country, we can detect an earthquake with high probability (96% of earthquakes of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seismic intensity scale 3 or more are detected) merely by monitoring tweets. Our system detects earthquakes promptly and sends e-mails to registered users.

238,e4a61ff6-9d9e-35ee-b48f-65ed5efa0fbd,A survey of opinion mining and sentiment analysis,book_section,"Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is the computational study of peo- ple‚Äôs opinions, appraisals, attitudes, and emotions toward entities, in- dividuals, issues, events, topics and their attributes. The task is tech- nically challenging and practically very useful. For example, businesses always want to find public or consumer opinions about their products and services. Potential customers also want to know the opinions of existing users before they use a service or purchase a product. With the explosive growth of social media (i.e., reviews, forum dis- cussions, blogs and social networks) on the Web, individuals and or- ganizations are increasingly using public opinions in these media for their decision making. However, finding and monitoring opinion sites on the Web and distilling the information contained in them remains a formidable task because of the proliferation of diverse sites. Each site typically contains a huge volume of opinionated text that is not always easily deciphered in long forum postings and blogs. The average human reader will have difficulty identifying relevant sites and accurately sum- marizing the information and opinions contained in them. Moreover, it is also known that human analysis of text information is subject to con- siderable biases, e.g., people often pay greater attention to opinions that are consistent with their own preferences. People also have difficulty, owing to their mental and physical limitations, producing consistent results when the amount of information to be processed is large. Au- tomated opinion mining and summarization systems are thus needed, as subjective biases and mental limitations can be overcome with an objective sentiment analysis system. In the past decade, a considerable amount of research has been done in academia [58,76]. There are also numerous commercial companies that provide opinion mining services. In this chapter, we first define the opinion mining problem. From the definition, we will see the key technical issues that need to be addressed. We then describe various key mining tasks that have been studied in the research literature and their representative techniques. After that, we discuss the issue of detecting opinion spam or fake reviews. Finally, we also introduce the research topic of assessing the utility or quality of online reviews.",Mining Text Data,2012.0,"Liu, Bing; Zhang, Lei","['Opinion mining', 'Sentiment analysis']",http://www.mendeley.com/research/survey-opinion-mining-sentiment-analysis,8.0,1.0,,415-463,9781461432234,,,Springer US,,,,,,,False,288,"{'Lecturer': 11, 'Student  > Ph.

It distinguishes four sources of social capital and examines their dynamics. Applications of the concept in the sociological literature emphasize its role in social control, in family support, and in benefits mediated by extrafamilial networks. I provide examples of each of these positive functions. Negative consequences of the same processes also deserve attention for a balanced picture of the forces at play. I review four such consequences and illustrate them with relevant examples. Recent writings on social capital have extended the concept from an individual asset to a feature of communities and even nations. The final sections describe this conceptual stretch and examine its limitations. I argue that, as shorthand for the positive consequences of sociability, social capital has a definite place in sociological theory.

The last version of the Chinese FBDGs was compelled by Chinese Nutrition Society in 2007, and proclaimed by the Ministry of Health in early 2008. The new guidelines kept the skeleton of three parts, but expanded remarkably in volume and coverage. The guidelines for the general population consisted of 10 items, each containing: core information, a discussion and reference materials. The guidelines for particular groups contained more subgroups, and more detailed recommendations. The revised pagoda kept the previous food grouping and placement but altered the amount of some food groups. An image of a walker and a cup of water were added to the side of the pagoda.

It is surprising that, given the richness and depth of recent historical work on the psyche in the Victorian period, it has not informed contemporary trauma theory, the genealogical exploration of which seldom pushes back beyond Freud and then only to focus on the medico-legal discourse around the railway accident. The second part of the article acknowledges the salience of trauma studies in literary criticism today but points to the theoretical and historical problems of applying contemporary definitions of trauma to Victorian literature. Research on Victorian architectures of the psyche (in particular, states of altered consciousness, theories of memory, trance, emotion, and involuntary thought or ‚Äòunconscious cerebration‚Äô) can offer a fuller account of the emergence of trauma as a concept than critics have previously recognized.

It draws on the findings of an Economic and Social Research Council funded project which examined the contrasting expectations and interpretations of academic staff and students regarding undergraduate students' written assignments. It is suggested that the implicit models that have generally been used to understand student writing do not adequately take account of the importance of issues of identity and the institutional relationships of power and authority that surround, and are embedded within, diverse student writing practices across the university. A contrasting and therefore complementary perspective is used to present debates about ‚ÄògoodÀös and ‚ÄòpoorÀös student writing.

Through analysis of short video sequences the paper describes the way children use and invest meaning in these spaces.

In particular, it brings to the fore the crucial dimension of climate both as an element in colonial thinking and planning, and as a dynamic force impacting on the cultivation of transplanted American cotton. The climate of Dharwar was not quite what the cotton authorities had constructed it to be, and it was, moreover, undergoing change due to the impact of regional deforestation. Furthermore, the article shows how this failure to come to terms with local climate conditions and changes was symptomatic of a broader failure to consider the overall agricultural livelihoods of peasant cultivators. Apart from a brief period when prices were artificially high, peasants much preferred growing the accustomed indigenous cotton rather than the new exotic variety. In turn, cotton was less of a priority than the production of millet food crops. By exploring the ways in which climatic conditions interacted with the economic, social and technological processes of cotton production in Dharwar, this article highlights why American cotton cultivation failed to meet colonial expectations during this period while also revealing the fragile architectural edifice of colonial power. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Journal of Historical Geography,2012.0,"Hazareesingh, Sandip","['Climate', 'Colonial', 'Cotton', 'Dharwar', 'Improvement', 'Peasants']",http://www.mendeley.com/research/cotton-climate-colonialism-dharwar-western-india-18401880,1.0,,,1-17,38,1,,,,,,,,,False,21,"{'Student  > Ph.

One of the more dif cult aspects of these techniques is the inter-pretation of the linear functions, as these functions usually have nonzero coeff cients on all p variables. A common approach is to effectively ignore (treat as zero) any coef cients less than some threshold value, so that the function becomes simple and the interpretation becomes easier for the users. Such a procedure can be misleading. There are alternatives to principal component analysis which restrict the coef cients to a smaller number of possible values in the derivationof the linear functions,or replace the principalcomponentsby "" prin-cipal variables. "" This article introduces a new technique, borrowing an idea proposed by Tibshirani in the context of multiple regression where similar problems arise in interpreting regression equations.

By combining two shapes (spheres and cubes); two sizes (7.5cm and 15cm); two materials (fabric and plastic); and four behaviours (emitting light, emitting sound, vibrating or displaying no behaviour) we created 32 objects that differ for a single feature. In a between- participants study, 175 participants assessed and described the 32 objects. From this, seven dimensions were identified: pleasant; interesting; comfortable; playful; relaxing; special and surprising. In a second between-participants experiment 486 participants rated each object on the seven dimensions from the first study. Overall Spheres, Fabric, and Vibration were the preferred features, but for some of the dimensions specific combinations of features were rated more positively. This paper contribution is twofold: it provides a first study on the aesthetic of tangible interaction as a combination of form and behaviour outlining a potential instrument to measure it; and it provides empirical evidence of the value of experimenting with different forms (spheres) and material (fabric) even if they are difficult to create as they generate the strongest aesthetic effects.","Proceedings of the TEI '16: Tenth International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction - TEI '16",2016.0,"Petrelli, Daniela; Soranzo, Alessandro; Ciolfi, Luigina; Reidy, John","['Hybrid objects', 'aesthetics', 'behaviour', 'empirical study', 'form', 'material', 'perception', 'psychology']",http://www.mendeley.com/research/exploring-aesthetics-tangible-interaction,,,,100-108,,,['http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2839462.2839478'],,,,,,,,False,8,"{'Lecturer': 1, 'Student  > Ph.

This poses a dilemma for democratization, as the political opening creates pressures for the representation of long-suppressed voices, but the strain of socio-economic transformation engenders pressures for greater effectiveness in building market economies and democratic polities. How do new democracies cope with this dilemma? This article extends the author's previously published work on party-system institutionalization by focusing explicitly on this problem, including on how electoral reforms affect the distinct pulls of representation and effectiveness. Based on data from eastern European and former Soviet states compared to western European and Latin American experiences during their initial periods of democratization, the evidence shows that the institutionalization of representation and effectiveness in post-communism is more hazardous. Politics in the post-communist region is characterized by numerous contending parties, weak political actors and floating constituencies. Volatility is not only higher in comparison to other regions but continues unabated during successive elections. These conditions contribute to the ‚Äòineffective representation‚Äô evident in the relatively large share of wasted votes at each election, with significant sectors of the electorate left out from legislative representation. Electoral reforms reflect the twin pressures: changes in formula in the direction of proportional representation favour broader representation, but higher thresholds seeking greater effectiveness make more difficult entry into parliament. The resulting mechanical and strategic effects confirm the expected direction of the reforms, although the contrary pulls towards representation and effectiveness render difficult the stabilization of party competition.",Democratization,2005.0,"Bielasiak, Jack",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/party-competition-emerging-democracies-representation-effectiveness-postcommunism-beyond,,,,331 - 356,12,3,,,,,,,,,False,19,"{'Student  > Ph.

The extent to which this also meant that they had a range of political parties that cohered into anything like a stable party system was less clear, however. Different views have been expressed on this question, and it may also be queried how well current views of what the concept of party system implies fit with Central European (CE) developments. Investigation into the nature of the party systems that have developed after four free elections is first conducted in terms of their shape and size. From this perspective only Hungary and the Czech Republic have developed anything like a two-party system. The question of stable party representation in CE legislatures is then raised, and in this context Slovenia and Estonia show signs of party system development on a more plural basis.

The core claim of the capability approach is that assessments of the well-being or quality of life of a person, and judgements about equality or justice, or the level of development of a community or country, should not primarily focus on resources, or on people's mental states, but on the effective opportunities that people have to lead the lives they have reason to value. 1 The core concepts in the capability approach are a person's functionings, which are her beings and doings (for example, being well-fed or literate), and her capabilities (the genuine opportunities or freedoms to realize these functionings). In academia, the approach is now part of the standard curriculum in courses on welfare economics, development studies and political philosophy, and it is regularly taught as part of courses in education, disability studies, public health, and gender studies, among others. In September 2004, the Human Development and Capability Association was founded, following four well-attended international conferences on the capability approach. 2 The capability approach has also had political impact. Since 1990, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has annually published the Human Development Report, which is in part based on the capability approach. 3 There are also more than 500 regional or country-level Human Development Reports, which discuss regional, national and local development strategies using the same theoretical tools and framework. Some governments are also showing interest in the approach for national policy making. In Germany, the second national report on poverty and wealth took inspiration from the capability approach to analyze poverty and *I am grateful to Sabina Alkire, Constanze Binder, Avner de-Shalit, Bob Goodin, Jo Wolff, and three anonymous referees for comments and suggestions, and to the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) for financial support. 1 The approach has been pioneered by Amartya Sen and has more recently been further developed by Martha Nussbaum and others.

We conducted a systematic review of 87 quantitative studies, analyzing dif- ferent operationalizations and measures of game enjoyment, its determinants, and how these were related to other compo- nents of PX, such as flow, presence and immersion. Results suggest that game enjoyment describes the positive cognitive and affective appraisal of the game experience, and may in part be associated with the support of player needs and val- ues. Further, we outline that enjoyment is distinct from flow in that it may occur independently of challenge and cognitive involvement, and argue that enjoyment may be understood as the valence of the player experience.

268,fdceae2a-5316-3d8e-967f-80ad44b67a21,Point-Charge Calculations of Energy Levels of Magnetic Ions in Crystalline Electric Fields,journal,"The calculation of energy levels of magnetic ions in crystalline electric fields is often the cause of considerable confusion. This confusion largely arises, not through the fundamental theoretical principles which are now well established, but from the large number of different and often not fully defined notations used, occasional errors, and the fact that one author seldom gives an example of calculation from start to finish. This chapter contains no original contribution to the problem, but it is hoped that by illustrating how the energy levels may be calculated on the basis of a simple Point-charge ionic model of the crystal lattice, the connection between the various forms of crystal-field Hamiltonians will be clarified. Particular reference is made to fields of cubic symmetry. If the crystalline electric field effects are taken as a perturbation on the appropriate free-ion wave functions and energy levels, the problem becomes that of finding the perturbing Hamiltonian and its matrix elements. The energy levels in the crystal field can then be found from standard perturbation theory. The simple point-charge model used to calculate the Hamiltonian is known to possess several weaknesses. It neglects the finite extent of charges on the ions, the overlap of the magnetic ions' wave functions with those of neighboring ions, and the complex effects of ‚Äúscreening‚Äù of the magnetic electrons by the outer electron shells of the magnetic ion. However, it serves as a first approximation to illustrate the principles involved, and may be used to calculate ratios of terms of the same degree in the Hamiltonian for lattice sites of high symmetry, since these ratios are independent of the model used and are determined solely by the symmetry.",Solid State Physics - Advances in Research and Applications,1964.0,"Hutchings, M.

These systems require service users to have a care coordinator, written care plan and regular reviews of their care. Processes are required to be collaborative, recovery-focused and personalised but have rarely been researched. We aimed to obtain the views and experiences of stakeholders involved in community mental health care and identify factors that facilitate or act as barriers to personalised, collaborative, recovery-focused care.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a cross-national comparative study employing a concurrent transformative mixed-methods approach with embedded case studies across six service provider sites in England and Wales. The study included a survey of views on recovery, empowerment and therapeutic relationships in service users (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ448) and recovery in care coordinators (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ201); embedded case studies involving interviews with service providers, service users and carers (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ117) and a review of care plans (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ33). Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed within and across sites using inferential statistics, correlations and framework method.\n\nRESULTS: Significant differences were found across sites for scores on therapeutic relationships. Variation within sites and participant groups was reported in experiences of care planning and understandings of recovery and personalisation. Care plans were described as administratively burdensome and were rarely consulted. Carers reported varying levels of involvement. Risk assessments were central to clinical concerns but were rarely discussed with service users. Service users valued therapeutic relationships with care coordinators and others, and saw these as central to recovery.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Administrative elements of care coordination reduce opportunities for recovery-focused and personalised work. There were few common understandings of recovery which may limit shared goals. Conversations on risk appeared to be neglected and assessments kept from service users. A reluctance to engage in dialogue about risk management may work against opportunities for positive risk-taking as part of recovery-focused work. Research to investigate innovative approaches to maximise staff contact time with service users and carers, shared decision-making in risk assessments, and training designed to enable personalised, recovery-focused care coordination is indicated.",BMC psychiatry,2016.0,"Simpson, Alan; Hannigan, Ben; Coffey, Michael; Barlow, Sally; Cohen, Rachel; Jones, Aled; V≈°eteƒçkov√°, Jitka; Faulkner, Alison; Thornton, Alexandra; Cartwright, Martin",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/recoveryfocused-care-planning-coordination-england-wales-crossnational-mixed-methods-comparative-cas,1.0,,,147,16,1,['http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=4868048&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract'],,,,,,,,False,11,"{'Student  > Ph.

Investigating the Shifting Political Strategies of Biopharmaceutical Industry Associations in Innovation Systems of South Africa and India,journal,"The role of industry associations in shaping policy through various lobbying activities is well established. In most cases, while such activities are deemed essential from an industry perspective, they also carry negative connotations connected to narrow rent-seeking and the pursuit of elites' interests which run counter to the public good and discourage competition and subsequent innovation. As such, industry associations have long been excluded from discussions regarding the relational dynamics and evolution of innovation systems. In contrast, this paper builds upon more recent work that places industry associations as key intermediary actors that facilitate knowledge exchange and institutional capacity building, particularly in the context of developing countries where limited institutional capacities and substantial knowledge gaps can limit both innovation and development. Employing a qualitative cross-national comparison, this paper examines the changing roles and activities of biopharmaceutical industry associations in the development of the South African and Indian pharmaceutical industries, with a particular focus on government-industry relations. For doing so, the paper captures developments during three main periods through which both the South African and Indian biopharmaceutical industries have similarly evolved, although within different national contexts: (1) pre-liberalization, (2) expanding pluralism, and (3) increasing partnership. We argue that in South Africa and India, particular historical trajectories and lack of institutional capacities are shifting industry associations away from ineffective lobbying to a new political approach that emphasizes partnering with government in the pursuit of not only narrow industry objectives, but also broader development aims.",World Development,2016.0,"Papaioannou, Theo; Watkins, Andrew; Mugwagwa, Julius; Kale, Dinar","['Developing countries', 'Industry associations', 'Innovation systems', 'Pluralism', 'Politics of development']",http://www.mendeley.com/research/lobby-partner-investigating-shifting-political-strategies-biopharmaceutical-industry-associations-in,2.0,1.0,,66-79,78,,,Elsevier Ltd,,,,,,,False,38,"{'Lecturer': 1, 'Student  > Ph.

This concept provides a framework by which developing countries can adopt for purposes of catching up. Initially conceived on structures and interactions identified in economically advanced countries, the application of the NIS concept to developing countries has been gradual and has coincided - in the NIS literature - with a move away from overly macro-interpretations to an emphasis on micro-level interactions and processes, with much of this work questioning the nation state as the most appropriate level of analysis, as well as the emergence of certain intermediary actors thought to facilitate knowledge exchange between actors and institutions. This paper reviews the NIS literature chronologically, showing how this shift in emphasis has diminished somewhat the importance of both institutions, particularly governments, and the political processes of institutional capacity building. In doing so, the paper suggests that more recent literature on intermediaries such as industry associations may offer valuable insights to how institutional capacity building occurs and how it might be directed, particularly in the context of developing countries where governance capacities are often lacking, contributing to less effective innovation systems, stagnant economies, and unequal development.",Research Policy,2015.0,"Watkins, Andrew; Papaioannou, Theo; Mugwagwa, Julius; Kale, Dinar","['Development', 'Industry associations', 'Institutional capacity', 'Intermediaries', 'Knowledge exchange', 'National innovation systems']",http://www.mendeley.com/research/national-innovation-systems-intermediary-role-industry-associations-building-institutional-capacitie,10.0,1.0,,1407-1418,44,8,,Elsevier,,,,,,,False,140,"{'Lecturer': 4, 'Student  > Ph.

Measurements are made as a function of dose rate and nanoparticle concentration. Possible mechanisms for hydroxyl radical production are considered in turn: energy deposition in the nanoparticles followed by its transport into the surrounding environment is unable to account for observed yield whereas energy deposition in the water followed by a catalytic-like reaction at the water-nanoparticle interface can account for the total yield and its dependence on dose rate and nanoparticle concentration. This finding is important because current models used to account for nanoparticle enhancement to radiobiological damage only consider the primary interaction with the nanoparticle, not with the surrounding media. Nothing about the new mechanism appears to be specific to gold, the main requirements being the formation of a structured water layer in the vicinity of the nanoparticle possibly through the interaction of its charge and the water dipoles. The massive hydroxyl radical production is relevant to a number of application fields, particularly nanomedicine since the hydroxyl radical is responsible for the majority of radiation-induced DNA damage.",Small,2014.0,"Sicard-Roselli, C√©cile; Brun, Emilie; Gilles, Manon; Baldacchino, G√©rard; Kelsey, Colin; McQuaid, Harold; Polin, Chris; Wardlow, Nathan; Currell, Frederick","['coumarin', 'gold nanoparticles', 'hydroxyl radicals', 'water-nanoparticle interfaces']",http://www.mendeley.com/research/new-mechanism-hydroxyl-radical-production-irradiated-nanoparticle-solutions,8.0,27.0,,3338-3346,10,16,,Wiley-VCH Verlag,,,,,,,False,46,"{'Lecturer': 2, 'Student  > Ph.

279,577dd663-aaa2-3b18-b7a7-735ce8755442,Maternal and child undernutrition: consequences for adult health and human capital,generic,"In this paper we review the associations between maternal and child undernutrition with human capital and risk of adult diseases in low-income and middle-income countries. We analysed data from five long-standing prospective cohort studies from Brazil, Guatemala, India, the Philippines, and South Africa and noted that indices of maternal and child undernutrition (maternal height, birthweight, intrauterine growth restriction, and weight, height, and body-mass index at 2 years according to the new WHO growth standards) were related to adult outcomes (height, schooling, income or assets, offspring birthweight, body-mass index, glucose concentrations, blood pressure). We undertook systematic reviews of studies from low-income and middle-income countries for these outcomes and for indicators related to blood lipids, cardiovascular disease, lung and immune function, cancers, osteoporosis, and mental illness. Undernutrition was strongly associated, both in the review of published work and in new analyses, with shorter adult height, less schooling, reduced economic productivity, and-for women-lower offspring birthweight. Associations with adult disease indicators were not so clear-cut. Increased size at birth and in childhood were positively associated with adult body-mass index and to a lesser extent with blood pressure values, but not with blood glucose concentrations. In our new analyses and in published work, lower birthweight and undernutrition in childhood were risk factors for high glucose concentrations, blood pressure, and harmful lipid profiles once adult body-mass index and height were adjusted for, suggesting that rapid postnatal weight gain-especially after infancy-is linked to these conditions. The review of published works indicates that there is insufficient information about long-term changes in immune function, blood lipids, or osteoporosis indicators. Birthweight is positively associated with lung function and with the incidence of some cancers, and undernutrition could be associated with mental illness. We noted that height-for-age at 2 years was the best predictor of human capital and that undernutrition is associated with lower human capital. We conclude that damage suffered in early life leads to permanent impairment, and might also affect future generations. Its prevention will probably bring about important health, educational, and economic benefits. Chronic diseases are especially common in undernourished children who experience rapid weight gain after infancy. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The system answers questions, executes commands, and accepts information in an interactive English dialog. It is based on the belief that in modeling language understanding, we must deal in an integrated way with all of the aspects of language-syntax, semantics, and inference. The system contains a parser, a recognition grammar of English, programs for semantic analysis, and a general problem solving system. We assume that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can understand the subject it is discussing. Therefore, the program is given a detailed model of a particular domain. In addition, the system has a simple model of its own mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carrying them out. It enters into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences with actions and English replies, asking for clarification when its heuristic programs cannot understand a sentence through the use of syntactic, semantic, contextual, and physical knowledge. Knowledge in the system is represented in the form of procedures, rather than tables of rules or lists of patterns. By developing special procedural representations for syntax, semantics, and inference, we gain flexibility and power. Since each piece of knowledge can be a procedure, it can call directly on any other piece of knowledge in the system. ¬© 1972.",Cognitive Psychology,1972.0,"Winograd, Terry",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/understanding-natural-language-22,,,,1-191,3,1,,,,,,,,,False,84,"{'Lecturer': 4, 'Student  > Ph.

A critical look at the ""pure relationship""",journal,"It has recently been claimed that a particular form of intimacy, 'the pure relationship' is increasingly sought in personal life. For a couple, 'the pure relationship' involves opening out to each other, enjoying each other's unique qualities and sustaining trust through mutual disclosure. Anthony Giddens (1992) postulates a transformation of intimacy in all personal relationships with  radical consequences for the gender order. Popular discourse supports the view that heterosexual couples are more equal and intimate. However, stories of everyday lives told to researchers paint a very qualified picture. Much of personal life  remains structured by inequalities. Gendered struggles with the gap between cultural  ideals and structural inequalities result in a range of creative identity and  relationship-saving strategies. More, perhaps much more, creative energy goes into sustaining a sense of intimacy despite inequality than into a process of transformation.  Moreover, the rhetoric of 'the pure relationship' may point people in the wrong direction  both personally and politically. It feeds on and into a therapeutic discourse that individualises personal problems and down-grades sociological explanations. In practice, intimacy remains multi-dimensional and for the contenders for  successful heterosexual equality, acts of practical love and care have been more important  than a constant dynamic of mutual exploration of each other's selves.

A part is cut in two, and the contour, or profile, of the resulting new surface is measured to determine the displacements caused by release of the residual stresses. Analytically, for example using a finite element model, the opposite of the measured contour is applied to the surface as a displacement boundary condition. By Bueckner‚Äôs superposition principle, this calculation gives the original residual stresses normal to the plane of the cut. This ‚Äúcontour method‚Äù is more powerful than other relaxation methods because it can determine an arbitrary cross-sectional area map of residual stress, yet more simple because the stresses can be determined directly from the data without a tedious inversion technique.

While the external loadings acting on a material or component are clearly important, There are other contributory factors including unfavourable materials microstructure, pre- existing defects and residual stresses. Residual stresses can add to, or subtract from, the applied stresses and so when unexpected failure occurs it is often because residual stresses have combined critically with the applied stresses, or because together with the presence of undetected defects they have dangerously lowered the applied stress at which failure will occur. Consequently it is important that the origins of residual stress are understood, opportunities for removing harmful or introducing beneficial residual stresses recognized, their evolution in-service predicted, their influence on failure processes understood and safe structural integrity assessments made, so as to either remove the part prior to failure, or to take corrective action to extend life.

Found at middle and high martian latitudes (particularly in the southern hemisphere), gullies within the walls of a very small number of impact craters, south polar pits, and two of the larger martian valleys display geomorphic features that can be explained by processes associated with groundwater seepage and surface runoff. The relative youth of the landforms is indicated by the superposition of the gullies on otherwise geologically young surfaces and by the absence of superimposed landforms or cross-cutting features, including impact craters, small polygons, and eolian dunes. The limited size and geographic distribution of the features argue for constrained source reservoirs.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2000.0,"Malin, M C; Edgett, K S",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/evidence-recent-groundwater-seepage-surface-runoff-mars,,,,2330-2335,288,5475,,,,,,,,,False,158,"{'Lecturer': 2, 'Student  > Ph.

For the purposes of the study, the research employed a systematic review approach. In order to reveal trends in research themes, emphasize theoretical/conceptual backgrounds, research designs and models, first a document analysis was used to collect data and this was followed by a content analysis. Our research findings indicate that MOOC research is generally derived from education, engineering and computer science, as well¬†as information and communication technology related disciplines. Qualitative methodology linked to a case study research model is most common, and the theoretical/conceptual backgrounds are usually distance education related.

This paper clarifies the image lag mechanism and proposes a new photodiode structure having no image lag. The image lag measurement method and the experimental results are also given. The experimental results quantitatively agreed with the analytical model, in which signal electrons are assumed to be transferred from the PD to the vertical CCD as a small subthreshold current. To eliminate the image lag, a P+NP-structure PD with low donor concentration was proposed, where all the signal electrons can be quickly transferred before the subthreshold condition begins.

Although it is now accepted that the central nervous system undergoes constant immune surveillance that takes place within the meningeal compartment, the mechanisms governing the entrance and exit of immune cells from the central nervous system remain poorly understood. In searching for T-cell gateways into and out of the meninges, we discovered functional lymphatic vessels lining the dural sinuses. These structures express all of the molecular hallmarks of lymphatic endothelial cells, are able to carry both fluid and immune cells from the cerebrospinal fluid, and are connected to the deep cervical lymph nodes. The unique location of these vessels may have impeded their discovery to date, thereby contributing to the long-held concept of the absence of lymphatic vasculature in the central nervous system.

Regulation of the composition and volume of these fluids is important for effective functioning of brain cells and is achieved by barriers that prevent free exchange between CNS and blood and by mechanisms that secrete fluid of controlled composition into the brain and distribute and reabsorb it. Structures associated with this regular fluid turnover include the choroid plexuses, brain capillaries comprising the blood-brain barrier, arachnoid villi and perineural spaces penetrating the cribriform plate. ISF flow, estimated from rates of removal of markers from the brain, has been thought to reflect rates of fluid secretion across the blood-brain barrier, although this has been questioned because measurements were made under barbiturate anaesthesia possibly affecting secretion and flow and because CSF influx to the parenchyma via perivascular routes may deliver fluid independently of blood-brain barrier secretion. Fluid secretion at the blood-brain barrier is provided by specific transporters that generate solute fluxes so creating osmotic gradients that force water to follow. Any flow due to hydrostatic pressures driving water across the barrier soon ceases unless accompanied by solute transport because water movements modify solute concentrations. CSF is thought to be derived primarily from secretion by the choroid plexuses. Flow rates measured using phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging reveal CSF movements to be more rapid and variable than previously supposed, even implying that under some circumstances net flow through the cerebral aqueduct may be reversed with net flow into the third and lateral ventricles. Such reversed flow requires there to be alternative sites for both generation and removal of CSF. Fluorescent tracer analysis has shown that fluid flow can occur from CSF into parenchyma along periarterial spaces. Whether this represents net fluid flow and whether there is subsequent flow through the interstitium and net flow out of the cortex via perivenous routes, described as glymphatic circulation, remains to be established. Modern techniques have revealed complex fluid movements within the brain.

Recent experimental work has shown, however, that long-range internal stresses prevail also in crystals containing dislocation wall or cell structures which have so far been considered as energetically favourable dislocation patterns of negligible internal stress. These experimental results are interpreted in terms of a simple model in which the crystal is considered as a composite consisting of hard dislocation walls of high local dislocation density which are separated by soft regions of low local dislocation density. The model is developed for single-slip and multiple-slip deformation. The considerations show that, in crystals in which a heterogeneous dislocation distribution develops during deformation, substantial long-range internal stresses arise unavoidably as a natural consequence of the compatibility requirements in the stress-applied state. A discussion of the microscopic glide processes makes it evident that, in addition to the dislocations located in the walls and in the regions separating them, so-called ""interface dislocations"" must be considered also. The latter maintain compatibility and give rise to long-range internal stresses (in the absence of dislocation pile-ups). These long-range internal stresses aid the applied stress in the walls and oppose it between the walls. They can be evaluated quantitatively from experiment and are readily interpreted in terms of the model. Beyond that the composite concept leads to a simple description of the macroscopic flow stress in terms of local properties of the heterogeneous dislocation microstructure and provides a convenient distinction between micro- and macroplasticity in monotonie and cyclic deformation. ?? 1983.",Acta Metallurgica,1983.0,"Mughrabi, H.",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/dislocation-wall-cell-structures-longrange-internal-stresses-deformed-metal-crystals,,,,1367-1379,31,9,,,,,,,,,False,109,"{'Student  > Ph.

310,5e0e4a51-177e-3f8f-802c-def2f2cb1a85,Do Deep Nets Really Need to be Deep ?,journal,"Currently, deep neural networks are the state of the art on problems such as speech recognition and computer vision. In this extended abstract, we show that shal- low feed-forward networks can learn the complex functions previously learned by deep nets and achieve accuracies previously only achievable with deep models. Moreover, in some cases the shallow neural nets can learn these deep functions using a total number of parameters similar to the original deep model. We eval- uate our method on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task and are able to train shallow fully-connected nets that perform similarly to complex, well-engineered, deep convolutional architectures. Our success in training shallow neural nets to mimic deeper models suggests that there probably exist better algorithms for train- ing shallow feed-forward nets than those currently available.",arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.6184,2013.0,"Ba, Lj; Caurana, R",,http://www.mendeley.com/research/deep-nets-really-need-deep,,,,1-6,2014,,['http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6184'],,,,,,,,False,1027,"{'Lecturer': 9, 'Student  > Ph.
